### Ingredients:
- 8 oz halloumi cheese
- neutral oil, to fry
Flour Coating:
- 1/2 cup AP flour
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp dried parsley
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- pinch of salt and pepper
Egg Coating:
- 2 large eggs
- pinch of salt and pepper
Panko Coating:
- 1 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- pinch of salt and pepper

### Recipe:
1. In three shallow dishes, whisk together the three different coatings to prepare for dredging. Set each aside. 
2. Place halloumi cheese on a cutting board. Slice into long thin strips to resemble the shape of a french fry. 
3. Dredge each halloumi fry and set aside. 
4. Add some oil to a frying pan and heat to 350 degrees. 
5. Drop nuggets in and fry until golden brown on all sides, should only take 2-3 mins if oil is hot enough. 
6. Remove from oil and transfer to a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. 
7. Serve with ketchup or marinara.
