### Ingredients:
For the Garlic Herb Butter:
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
- 2 tsp fresh thyme, finely chopped
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- black pepper (to taste)
For the Potato Stacks:
- 3 lb yellow or yukon gold potatoes, sliced 1/16" thick (mandolin)
- 12-18 small sprigs fresh thyme
- 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese

### Recipe:
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly brush the cups of a 12 cup muffin tin with neutral oil. Pile stacks up high for 12 slightly heaped stacks, keeping in mind the potatoes will sink as they cook. 
2. Melt butter and stir in garlic, parsley, chopped thyme, salt, and pepper. Set aside to cool. 
3. Place potatoes in a large mixing bowl and toss with cooled garlic herb butter. 
4. Assemble potato stacks. In each oiled cup, place a small sprig of thyme, followed by slices of potatoes starting with smaller pieces and ending with larger. About 1/3rd and 2/3rds of the way up the stack, sprinkle a bit of grated parmesan. For the prettiest stacks, stagger slices a little rather than matching in a neat column. Divide evenly among the cups. 
5. Cover muffin tin tightly with foil. Bake for 25 mins or until potatoes are tender. Increase oven to 425 degrees. Remove foil and return to bake uncovered for 13-15 mins more, or whenever edges are browned and crispy and tops are golden brown. 
6. use a wooden skewer to dislodge stacks from the muffin tin by gently pushing the tip down one side and flipping enough to grab with tongs. Serve upside down, and finish with a sprinkle of flaky salt. Serve.
