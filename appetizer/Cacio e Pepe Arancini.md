### Ingredients:
- [[Calabrian Chili Aioli]]
Risotto: 
- 1 qt chicken stock
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 med onion, finely diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup carnaroli rice
- 1/2 cup white wine
- 1 1/4 cups fresh grated parmesan
- 3 oz butter, cubed and cold
- 1-2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp pepper
Arancini:
- 3 oz mozzarella, cut into 1/4in cubes
- 1 cup AP flour
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1 cup panko
- 4 cups fryer oil

### Recipe:
1. Bring chicken stock to a simmer in a med pot. 
2. In a separate wide pot, heat oil on med heat until shimmering. Add onions and garlic and saute until translucent, being careful not to let them brown. Add rice and toast for 2 mins, stirring frequently. Pour wine into the rice, stirring bottom of the pot to release any stuck rice. Cook until rice has absorbed the wine, then begin to add the hot chicken stock one cup at a time. 
3. Continue cooking and stirring the pot every few mins to prevent rice from sticking to the bottom. Once most of the stock is absorbed, add another cup. This should be done 4-5 times and take 30-40 mins. Cook in this manner until the rice is cooked al dente and the stock is absorbed. Remove from heat. 
4. Add 1 cup parmesan, butter, salt, and pepper. Pour the cooked risotto on a sheet tray to cool until cool enough to handle. 
5. For the arancini: Using a large spoon, scoop about 1/4 cup risotto into your hands and form a ball about 2 in in diameter. Make a well in the ball with your thumb and place a mozzarella cube in the center. Repeat with remaining risotto. 
6. Place the flour, egg, and breadcrumbs each in a small bowl. Dredge the balls in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs. Hold the balls on a sheet tray or freeze until ready to fry. 
7. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or skillet to 350 degrees. Place balls in oil and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 5 mins. (Maybe try the air fryer?)
8. For the chili aioli: Mix together canola and chili oil together in a small bowl. Place the egg yolks and dijon in a food processor, then, while the motor is running, slowly stream the oil into the center until half the oil is fully emulsified. Slowly stream in 1/4 cup water, then continue to stream in remaining oil until fully emulsified. Carefully scrape the aioli into a small bowl. Add in lemon juice, paprika, salt, and garlic to the bowl and mix well to incorporate.
9. To serve: Place 4 dollops chili aioli directly on the serving plate, then place the risotto balls on top of each dollop. Garnish with grated parm.
