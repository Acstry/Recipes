3. For the Muffins: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grab a 12-count muffin pan and line with muffin cups or butter.
4. In a large bowl, whisk together cornmeal, flour, baking powder, cornstarch, and salt until combined. 
5. In a med bowl, whisk together the melted butter and brown sugar until dissolved. Stir in the egg and buttermilk. Set aside. 
6. Pour wet ingredients into dry and whisk until incorporated. Fold in the diced jalapenos until just combined. 
7. Fill each muffin tin halfway with batter. Take about a 1/2 tbsp of cream filling and place in center. Cover with more filling to top. 
8. Bake for 18-20 mins, or until tops of muffins are golden. Serve with a slab of butter.
