### Ingredients:
Pasta Salad:
- 1 lb pasta, cooked al dente to box instructions
- 1/2 lb prosciutto
- 1-2 burrata balls
- 1/2 head radicchio, sliced thinly in  2" strips
- 2 handfuls basil, julienned
- 8 oz jarred roasted red peppers, chopped
- 5 oz castelvetrano olives, halved
- 1/2 cup capers
- 1/2 bulb fennel, thinly sliced or grated (optional)
- freshly grated parmesan (to taste)
Dressing: 
- 1/2 shallot, minced
- crushed red pepper flakes
- salt and pepper (to taste)
- 4 garlic cloves
- 5 anchovies
- 1 lemon
- 1-4 dashes red wine vinegar
- 1/2 cup olive oil

### Recipe:
1. Heat oven to (?) degrees. On a lined baking sheet, lay out prosciutto slices and bake for 12-15 min, until golden brown. Allow to cool, then crumble into small pieces. Set aside.
2. In a small pot, heat a splash of olive oil (just enough to cover bottom of pan). Pour capers onto a paper towel and dry well. Add to hot oil and fry until they begin to "bloom", ~4 mins, being careful to avoid burning. Remove, drain on a paper towel, and set aside. 
3. Mince together garlic, shallot, and anchovies finely, until a paste is formed. Move to a small bowl. Add in remaining dressing ingredients. Be light with the salt and heavy with the pepper. Whisk until well incorporated and set aside. 
4. Add pasta into a large bowl. Add about 1/2 the dressing and mix well. Top with prosciutto, radicchio, basil, red peppers, olives, capers, and fennel. Cover with remaining dressing. Mix again. 
5. Top with spoonfuls of burrata and whole basil leaves. Do not mix in burrata. Serve.
