### Ingredients:
- 15 rice cakes
- 15 mini hot dogs
- 5 wooden skewers
- 2 tbsp ketchup
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 3 tbsp mild gochujang
- 1 tsp gochugaru
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 to 2 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tbsp neutral oil
- sesame seeds and chopped green onion, to garnish

### Recipe:
1. Boil rice cakes in hot water for 10-15 mins to soften.
2. Thread a rice cake onto a wooden skewer, followed by a mini hot dog. Repeat until each skewer has 3 of each.
3. Heat a pan over med heat and add oil. Fry skewers for 5-7 mins, turning occasionally until rice cakes are crispy and hot dogs are nicely browned. 
4. In a small bowl, mix together the ketchup, next 5 ingredients, and a splash of warm water. Stir until the sugar is dissolved and sauce is well combined. 
5. Brush the cooked skewers generously with sauce while still in the hot pan. Allow to cook another 1-2 mins to allow sauce to caramelize and adhere to skewers.
6. Remove from pan, garnish, and serve hot.
