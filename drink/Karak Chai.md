- 2 cups water
- 2 cups evaporated milk
- 6-8 cardamom pods, lightly crushed
- 3 cinnamon sticks
- 1 small piece fresh ginger
- 1/4 cup brown sugar, or to taste
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

### Recipe:
1. In a med pot, combine the water, milk, cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks, and ginger. Bring mixture to a gentle boil.
