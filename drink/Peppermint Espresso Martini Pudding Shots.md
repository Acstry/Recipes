### Ingredients:
- 1 4oz box instant chocolate pudding mix
- 3/4 cup cold milk
- 1/2 cup vodka
- 1/4 cup peppermint schnapps
- 2-3 tbsp instant espresso powder
- 2 cups heavy whipping cream, cold
- 1 tsp peppermint extract
- Optional: sprinkles and peppermint bark for topping

### Recipe:
1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together pudding mix, vodka, peppermint schnapps, and espresso powder until smooth. 
2. Add the heavy cream and peppermint extract to a separate bowl and use an electric mixer to beat until soft peaks form.
3. Add 1 1/2 cups of the peppermint whipped cream to the pudding mixture and whisk until smooth. Reserve the rest of the whipped cream in the fridge for topping. 
4. Pour the pudding mix into 2 oz plastic shot glasses, filling it about 3/4 of the way. Refrigerate for 30-60 mins, until mostly set. The mixture will be soft but not liquidy.
5. Pipe reserved whipped cream on top of each shot, garnish, and serve.
