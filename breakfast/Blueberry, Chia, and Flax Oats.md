### Ingredients:
- 2/3 cup rolled oats
- 1 1/4 cup water
- 1 tbsp chia seeds
- 1 tbsp flax meal
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 1/4 cup frozen blueberries
- 1 pinch salt
- 1/2 cup hot water

### Recipe:
1. Combine the oats and water. Either cook on the stovetop until they begin to thicken, or add them to a large microwave safe bowl and cook for 4 mins, stopping every min to stir. 
2. Remove the oats from stove or microwave when they have begun to thicken. Add in chia seeds and flax meal and stir to combine. Let the oats sit for 3-5 mins, allowing seeds to absorb moisture. 
3. If oats get too thick, dilute with a splash of hot water and stir. 
4. Once the oats are reasonably thick, add the cinnamon, salt, and blueberries. Stir. Optionally, put oats in microwave another 30 secs if you want them very hot. 
5. Top with peanut butter (if desired) and another pinch of cinnamon and stir.
