### Ingredients:
Cinnamon Brown Sugar Filling:
- 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 2 tbsp cinnamon
Muffin Dough:
- 1/4 cup warm water
- 1/2 tsp sugar
- 1 pkg active dry yeast
- 3 1/2 cup AP flour
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2/3 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 egg, room temp
- 1/2 cup warm milk
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 12 tbsp heavy whipping cream
- 2 tbsp icing sugar
Glaze (optional):
- 1 cup icing sugar
- 2-5 tbsp milk

### Recipe:
1. For the Dough: Combine water, 1 tsp sugar, and yeast in a small bowl. Stir until yeast dissolves. Let sit for 5 mins until a foam begins to form. 
2. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, and salt and stir. Make a well in the middle and add in butter, eggs, vanilla, milk, and yeast. 
3. Mix until a sticky cohesive dough forms. Cover the bowl with a dish cloth and place in a warm place to rise until doubled, about 30-45 mins. Meanwhile, butter a muffin tin and prepare filling and glaze. 
4. For the Filling: Combine all ingredients in a med bowl and mix well to combine. Set aside.
5. For the Glaze: Combine sifted sugar and milk in a large bowl. Add enough milk to achieve desired consistency. 
6. After first proof: Punch down the dough and transfer onto a floured surface. Roll the dough into a rectangle, about 16 by 20". 
7. Spread the cinnamon filling on top of the dough, all the way to the edges. 
8. Fold the dough into thirds, starting by pulling the top long edge 2/3rds of the way down and the bottom edge all the way up to get a long strip of dough, like folding a letter.
9. Trim the uneven ends off the strip. Mark and cut the dough into 12 equal strips. 
10. Cut each strip of dough into 3 strands, leaving the top half inch of the strip attached. Braid or twist the strands of each strip. Roll the braid into a roll, starting with the end of the braid. Place each roll into the muffin tin, pretty side up. 
11. Let rise until the rolls fill out the muffin tin (double in size), about 10-15 mins. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
12. Pour 1 tbsp heavy cream over each muffin roll. Bake for 18-20 mins or until the rolls are golden brown on top. Let cool for 5 mins before lifting onto a cooling rack. Sift icing sugar over cinnamon rolls and drizzle glaze before serving.
