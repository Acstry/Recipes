### Ingredients:
Galette: 
- 1 pie crust
- 8 oz cream cheese, room temp
- 1 tbsp za'atar seasoning (optional)
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 large egg
- 2-3 tbsp everything bagel seasoning
- 6-8 oz smoked salmon
- sumac red onions, to top
- sliced cucumbers, to top
- capers, to top
Sumac Red Onions:
- 1 red onion, thinly sliced
- juice of 1 lemon
- 1/2 tbsp sumac
- 1/2 tsp salt

### Recipe:
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. On a sheet tray, roll out the chilled pie dough to about 12" diameter. Take a 9" cake pan and gently press it into the center of the dough to leave an indent. 
2. In a bowl, combine the cream cheese, za'atar, and salt. Spoon the filling in the center of the dough in an even layer, keeping within the indent. Fold the remaining dough over the cream cheese, every 3-4 in, to enclose it. Whisk the egg with 1 tbsp water until combined. Brush over the edges and top with everything bagel seasoning.
3. Bake for 25-35 mins, or until the crust is golden brown. Remove and let cool until cream cheese is set.
4. While galette cools, mix together the sumac red onion ingredients. Let sit to marinate. 
5. Prior to serving, top with salmon, red onions, sliced cucumbers, capers, and black pepper.
