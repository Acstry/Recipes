### Ingredients:
- 1 unsliced Brioche, Challah, or Pullman's loaf, preferably 1-2 days old
For the orange Creme Anglaise:
- 1/2 cup whole milk
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 4 tsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- Several 1"-wide strips of rind from half a small orange
- 3 egg yolks
- 1/8 tsp fine sea salt
For the soaking liquid: 
- 2 1/2 cup whole milk
- 1 cinnamon stick or 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon
- Several 1"-wide strips of rind from remaining half of small orange
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1/8 tsp fine sea salt
For frying: 
- 2 whole eggs, whisked
- 1 1/3 cup high heat oil
For the brulee top:
- 4 tbsp sugar

### Recipe:
1. Make orange creme anglaise: Place milk, cream, orange rings, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt into a small pot. Warm over med heat to a gentle simmer. Remove from heat, cover, and steep 30 mins. 
2. Place yolks in a medium bowl and whisk vigorously for a few mins. Once milk is done steeping (and cooled), slowly pour it through a fine-mesh sieve into the egg yolk mixture. 
3. Transfer back into small pot and return to stove, heating over low and stirring constantly until mixture is thickened enough to coat the back of a metal spoon or reached 165 degrees with a thermometer. 
4. Remove from heat and pour again through sieve into a clean bowl. Once cool, place plastic wrap directly on the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming. Chill fully in fridge. 
5. Steep soaking liquid: Add milk, cinnamon, orange rinds, sugar, and salt into a small pot. Warm on stove over med heat to a gentle simmer. Remove from heat, cover, and steep 30 mins. 
6. Prepare bread: Trim crusts off the uncut loaf on all 6 sides, then cut loaf into 6 equally-sized blocks measuring ~ 2 1/2x2 1/2x3 (or similar, depending on dimensions of loaf). If using fresh bread, dry blocks in a 250 degree oven for 30 mins before proceeding to help them better absorb soaking liquid. 
7. Soak bread in milk: Pour steeped milk into a shallow dish just large enough to hold the liquid and all 6 slices of bread. Arrange bread in milk, turning the pieces until all sides soak evenly. Soak at least 30 mins up to a couple hour - the longer the soak, the more saturated and bread pudding-y the center will be. The bread should soak up all of the liquid. Be careful handling bread, as it will be quite soft. 
8. Prepare for frying: Set a pot or deep skillet over med heat. Pour enough oil that it comes up 1/2 to 3/4" high. Heat oil to 350 degrees, or when surface is shimmering and a dry wooden chopstick placed in the center creates rapid bubbles rising.
9. Fry Torrijas: Once oil is hot, dip bread pieces in whisked eggs, turning to coat all sides. Gently slide into hot oil to fry, flipping until golden on all sides. Repeat for all bread pieces, adjusting heat to maintain temp between 350 and 360 degrees. Place on a paper-towel lined plate to absorb excess oil. Transfer to a serving plate.
10. Serve: Top Torrijas with orange creme anglais followed by 2 tsp of sugar sprinkled over top. Brulee the sugar with a kitchen torch until sugar bubbles and turns a deep golden brown.
