### Ingredients:
- 2 med leeks, white + light green parts only, halved and thinly sliced
- 4 tbsp butter, separated
- 2 handfuls of baby spinach, roughly chopped
- 8 eggs
- 4 tbsp whole milk
- 3 tbsp sour cream
- 1/2 cup crumbled feta
- 1/2 cup shredded gruyere, to top
- 2 tbsp finely chopped dill, plus more to top
- salt, pepper, and zaatar (to taste)
- [[Garlic Yogurt]]

### Recipe:
1. In a large bowl, beat the eggs with the sour cream and milk until incorporated, but don't over-mix, or frittata will collapse. Add in half of the crumbled feta. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside. 
2. Heat 2 tbsp butter in a 8 in cast iron skillet. Melt until bubbly then add leeks and stir, cooking over med low heat until very soft and lightly caramelized. Season with salt and pepper, then add the spinach and mix until wilted and any moisture released is evaporated but green is still vibrant. Add the other 2 tbsp butter until melted, followed by the dill, and mix. 
3. Keeping med low heat, pour the egg mixture into the pan. The edges should slightly bubble. Using a rubber spatula, push the edges of the eggs inward towards the center of the pan, creating a sort of ripple effect. Repeat a few times going around the edge of the pan, shaking to ensure the leek mixture is evenly distributed. Once the edges are just beginning to set, top with the remaining crumbled feta and sprinkle the gruyere across the edges of the frittata to create a crust. 
4. Place the pan in an oven preheated to 375 degrees for about 15-17 mins or until puffed up and cheesy edges are golden. The center should be just slightly jiggly but not wet. Remove from the oven, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with zaatar or dried oregano if desired. Allow to sit for 10 mins before cutting.
