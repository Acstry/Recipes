### Ingredients:
L'Assida:
- 1/2 cup coarse semolina
- 2 cups water
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup milk
Sauteed Peppers:
- 3 bell peppers, thinly sliced
- 1 pkg sazon seasoning
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- salt and pepper (to taste)
Seared Mushrooms:
- 4 oz mushrooms of choice
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- pinch of salt and pepper

### Recipe:
1. Prepare the peppers: In a cast iron, add olive oil and heat. Add sliced peppers with salt and toss to coat. Cover and cook for 5 mins. Remove lid and add minced garlic and sazon. Continue stirring until wilted and slightly charred. Set aside.
2. Prepare mushrooms: In the same pan, heat oil. Add mushrooms and season with salt and pepper. Toss and cook for 3-4 mins until golden. Set aside. 
3. Prepare assida: Bring a pot of 2 cups of water to boil. Add the butter and salt, and stir until melted. Pour in the semolina and remove from heat. Continue stirring consistently until it thickens. Stir in milk (1/4 cup at a time) until a consistency similar to grits comes. Add more milk if needed.
4. Plate in a bowl. Serve with a drizzle of honey. Garnish with peppers and mushrooms, a fried egg, and fresh parsley.
