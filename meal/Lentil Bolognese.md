### Ingredients:
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1 med yellow onion, finely diced
- 4-5 cloves garlic, minced
- 2-3 med carrots, diced
- 3-4 stalks celery, diced
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 2 tbsp red wine vinegar
- 2 tbsp italian seasoning
- 2 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 tsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
- 2 bay leaves
- 1/2 cup red wine
- 42 oz crushed tomatoes
- 1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 cup dried green or brown lentils, cooked to pkg directions, drained 

### Recipe:
1. Heat olive oil in a large sauce pot, then saute onions for 7-10 mins, or until translucent and softened. Add garlic and continue cooking for 3-5 mins. 
2. Add carrots and celery and continue cooking for 7-10 mins, stirring often. Add tomato paste, red wine vinegar, italian seasoning, salt, sugar, pepper, red pepper flakes, and bay leaves. Add red wine and let reduce, stirring. 
3. Add tomatoes and simmer for at least one hr, stirring occasionally. 
4. When sauce is finished, use an immersion blender to roughly blend sauce - you don't want any large chunks of vegetables remaining, but you also don't want a complete puree. Just a few pulses will do. 
5. When finished, stir in lentils and parsley and serve over pasta of choice. Serve.
