3. Place 1/3 cup mozzarella cheese onto each rectangle, leaving 1-2" from each side free of toppings. 
4. Add a layer of salami, pepperoni, and sausage.
5. Add another 1/3 cup mozzarella cheese and top with diced tomatoes, tbsp each of parsley and basil, and any other desired toppings. 
6. Add the remaining 1/3 cup of cheese to each stromboli.
