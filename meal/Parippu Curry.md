For Coconut Paste:

1. Rinse moong dal and place in the instant pot. Add turmeric powder, asafoetida, and water.
2. Close the lid and cook for 10 mins, let pressure release naturally. 
3. Take grated coconut, cumin seeds, and garlic in a blender. Add water. Blend to an almost smooth paste (creamy, with a bit of texture).
4. Place the cooked dal in a pot. Add chili powder and salt. Mix well until combined. Add hot water if the dal is too thick. Bring it to a boil. Reduce heat and add the blended coconut paste. Stir and simmer for 2-3 mins. Turn off flame before it starts boiling.
