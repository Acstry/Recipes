MAKES 2 SERVINGS
### Recipe:
1. Add olive oil to a large, deep frying pan. When hot, add the chopped chicken. Season well and cook for 6-8 mins, stirring occasionally until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through. Set aside. 
2. Reduce the heat and, in the same pan, add garlic and cook for 30 secs before adding sun-dried tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, and paprika. Cook for a few mins until tomatoes are softened. 
3. Pour in the heavy cream and pasta water, tossing well and allow to bubble for a few mins so the cream can thicken. 
4. Add the chicken, cooked pasta, and spinach to sauce and stir well. Allow spinach to wilt. Add more pasta water as needed, until sauce is loose and glossy. 
5. Remove from heat and stir in the parmesan and basil leaves. Scoop into bowls, top with mroe parm, fresh basil, and black pepper.
