### Ingredients:
- 3 lbs chicken pieces of choice
- 4 large potatoes, quartered
- 1 tbsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp oregano
- 1 whole head of garlic
- 1/2 cup lemon juice
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1/2 cup water

### Recipe:
1. Combine chicken and potatoes in a large baking dish. Add in spices, a drizzle of olive oil, and salt to taste. 
2. Bake uncovered at 400 degrees for 30 mins. 
3. Using a mortar and pestle, smash garlic with 1 tsp of salt until it forms a paste. Add it to a cup with the olive oil, lemon juice, and water. Whisk together. 
4. Remove chicken from oven and pour sauce over top, turning chicken and potatoes so they're well coated, making sure chicken remains skin side up. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.
