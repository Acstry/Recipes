### Ingredients:
- 32 oz kefir (can sub. for greek yogurt slightly diluted)
- 3 med raw beets
- 2 cup cold water
- salt and pepper (to taste)
Toppings:
- 3 persian cucumbers, diced 
- small bunch of dill, finely chopped
- 4 green onions, thinly sliced
- 5 eggs, hard boiled
- 4 radishes, thinly sliced or diced
- 1 lb baby gold potatoes (ok to be a little heavy)
- olive oil
Note: Also fried up some summer sausage on the side. 

### Recipe:
1. For the beets: Remove the stems (leaving a small knob intact so the color doesn't fully bleed), wash and lightly scrub to remove dirt. Place in a med saucepan with cold water just covering them and boil over med high. Once boiling, bring to a simmer for 30-40 mins, until fork tender. Drain and allow to cool.
2. When cool enough to handle, place them under cool water and rub the skins off with your fingers. Store in fridge until cold. Once chilled through, use largest holes on a box shredder to shred the beets. 
3. For the eggs: Bring another pot of water to boil, carefully dropping in eggs and cook for 10 mins. Peel and set aside in fridge. 
4. For the potatoes: Place potatoes in a pot of heavily salted water. Bring to a simmer until potatoes are soft and fork tender, about 15 mins. Drain and, once cool, peel the skins off if desired. Sprinkle with chopped dill and drizzle of olive oil. (I wonder if you could boil the potatoes with the beets.)
5. For the soup: Into a large bowl, add the shredded beets, kefir, salt and pepper (to taste). Depending on the desired consistency, add cold water until reaching a desirable level.
6. To serve: Top with a bit of each topping, drizzle of olive oil, black pepper, and potatoes on the side.
