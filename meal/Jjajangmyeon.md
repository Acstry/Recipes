### Ingredients:
- jjajangmyeon noodles (thicker, flat)
- 1/2 lb pork belly, cut into 1/2in cubes
- 1 cup daikon radish, cut into 1/2in cubes
- 1 cup zucchini, cut into 1/2in cubes
- 1 cup potato, peeled and cut into 1/2in cubes
- 1 1/2 cup onion, cut into 1/2in pieces
- 3 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1/4 cup + 1 tbsp black bean paste
- 2 tbsp potato starch, combined with 1/4 cup water and 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1/2 cup cucumber, cut into matchsticks
Note: Noodles do not keep well in the fridge. Store separately. 

### Recipe:
1. Stir fry the pork belly in a large, deep pan with 1 tbsp of vegetable oil for ~4-5 mins, until golden brown and crispy. Drain.
2. Add radish and fry ~1 min. Add potato, onion, and zucchini and stir for ~3 mins until potato looks slightly translucent.
3. Clear a space in the center of the pan. Add 2 tbsp of vegetable oil to the center. Add 1/4 cup black bean paste and stir for ~1 min to fry. Then mix everything together and continue to stir. 
4. Add 2 cups of water and let simmer with the lid closed for about 10 mins. 
5. Open, test radish and potato. If soft, stir in the starch water little by little. Continue stirring until well-mixed and thickened. Add sesame oil.  
6. Remove from heat, add over noodles, and top with cucumber. Serve.
