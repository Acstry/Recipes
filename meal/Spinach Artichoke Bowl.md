### Ingredients:
- 2/3 cup ricotta cheese
- 3 tbsp freshly grated parm
- 3 garlic cloves, grated
- 1 tsp lemon zest
- 3 tbsp lemon juice
- 3 large fresh basil leaves
- 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
- 1/4 tsp pepper
- 6 tbsp water
- 2 tbsp olive oil

- 2 cans artichoke hearts, drained, rinsed, and halved
- 4-5 cups fresh spinach

1. In a large measuring cup, whisk together ricotta, parm, garlic, lemon zest and juice, red pepper flakes, and pepper. Add in water and whisk to form a sauce. Set aside. 
2. Place a large saute pan over med heat and add in olive oil. Let this heat up before adding shallots. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 4-5 mins. 
3. Add in artichoke and swirl to coat, then arrange in a flat layer across the pan and let them cook, undisturbed, for 5-6 mins or until pieces have gotten some color. Stir and cook another minute or so. 
4. Add in the spinach and stir, allowing to wilt. Season with salt. 
5. Pour in the ricotta mixture and stir, everything should start to thicken. This will happen quickly. If needed, add a splash of hot water to loosen. Remove from heat, taste, and season if needed.
