### Ingredients:
- 2 bundles garlic scapes
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1 small shallot, thinly sliced
- 1 lemon, juiced
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
- 2 1/2 cups water
- 4 large eggs
- salt and pepper (to taste)
- 1 cup farro, cooked to pkg directions
- 2 tbsp chili oil

### Recipe:
1. First, cut off the straight ends from the garlic scapes, slicing about 5 in from the bottom of the scape. Set aside the curly sections. Finely slice the straight ends into thin medallions. 
2. Put a dutch oven on med heat. Add 1/4 cup olive oil. When oil is hot, add sliced garlic scapes and shallots. Season with salt and cook down, stirring occasionally, until shallots have softened and become slightly translucent, about 4-5 mins. Add the lemon juice, red pepper flakes, and stir. Cook for another 1-2 mins, allowing the garlic scape slices to soften. Add in the 1/2 cup white wine, and let the mixture come to a simmer. Continue stirring occasionally as the alcohol cooks off, about 3-4 mins. 
3. Add in the water to the mixture. Stir to combine, then let the pot come to a low simmer. While this is happening, whisk together the eggs in a large bowl. 
4. When the soup is at a simmer, take a small ladle of the liquid and add it to the bowl with the eggs. Whisk immediately to incorporate it and slowly bring up temperature. Once first ladle is combined, repeat again with another slightly larger scoop of soup. 
5. Once eggs are tempered, add them to the dutch oven. Turn off the heat and stir quickly and continuously. Should not look like egg drop soup, but instead smooth and emulsified. Taste and adjust flavor with salt, pepper, and lemon juice as needed. 
6. Bring a cast-iron pan to med high heat. Add a generous glug of olive oil and sear the garlic scapes a few at a time until they are charred. This will take about 2 mins per side. Season them with salt and pepper. 
7. To plate, add a scoop of farro to a bowl, top with 2-3 curly scapes. Pour soup around the outside of the bowl. Top with chili oil, mix, and serve.
