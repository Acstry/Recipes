### Recipe:
1. While pasta is cooking, heat a saucepan or pot over med heat. Add the butter. Allow butter to melt and brown. Whisk in the flour and cook 1-2 mins until just begins to bubble. Whisk constantly to avoid clumping.

4. When pasta is done, drain and add to sauce. Mix until well coated and serve.
