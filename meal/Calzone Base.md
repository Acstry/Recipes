### Ingredients:
- 1 pkg regular active dry yeast
- 1 cup warm water
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 3 cups AP flour
- 1 egg, beaten
- prepared desired filling

### Recipe:
1. Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Allow to sit 8-10 mins, until foamy. 
2. Stir in sugar, oil, salt, and AP flour. Beat until smooth. 
3. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface, gently roll in flour to coat. Knead about 5 mins or until smooth and elastic. Cover and let rest for 5 mins.
4. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Spray large cookie sheet with nonstick spray. Divide dough into 6 equal parts. Roll or pat each part into 7 inch circle on floured surface, turning dough occasionally. 
5. Place about 1/3rd cup filling on half of each circle, spread to within 1 inch of edge. Fold dough over filling, fold edge up and pinch to seal. Place on cookie sheet.
6. Brush with egg white. Cut several slits in top surface of dough to vent steam. Bake 25 to 30 mins or until golden brown.
