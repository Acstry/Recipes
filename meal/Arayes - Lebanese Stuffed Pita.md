### Ingredients:
- 5 pitas, or pita pockets
Meat Filling:
- 1/2 onion, grated, include liquid
- 1 lb ground lamb or beef
- 2 cloves garlic, finely grated
- 1 tbsp parsley, finely chopped (optional)
- 3 tsp coriander
- 3 tsp cumin
- 1 1/2 tsp paprika
- 3/4 tsp allspice
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 1/4 tsp salt
Whipped Tahini Yogurt Sauce:
- 1 cup plain yogurt
- 2 tbsp tahini
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 garlic clove, finely grated
- 1/2 tsp salt

### Recipe:
1. In a bowl, add in all meat filling ingredients. Mix well with clean hands. 
2. Divide stuffing in 10 (~1/4 cup per). Flatten into a semi-circle shape slightly smaller than the pita bread half.
3. Gently open a pita and place meat inside. Close, then press to spread to the edge and make it fairly evenly flat. If pita is hard to work with or ripping: microwave pita for 30 secs. 
4. Preheat oven to 120 degrees. Place a rack on a tray (to keep cooked arayes warm).
5. Heat a large frying pan over med high heat. Spray both sides of the pita with olive oil, then place 2 or 3 pieces in the pan (whatever can fit without overlapping). Cook for about 2 mins on each side, pressing lightly with a spatula, until golden and crispy. 
6. Transfer cooked arayes onto rack to keep warm. Repeat with reamining pita. 
7. Place whipped tahini sauce ingredients in a heatproof bowl and whisk to combine. Microwave for 15 secs on high. Whisk again - it should resemble soft whipped cream. 
8. Cut into half if desired. Serve with whipped tahini sauce on side.
