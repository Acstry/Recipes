### Recipe:
1. If using lamb: Place lamb and olive oil in a large boil and toss to coat. Set aside.
2. In a small bowl, mix together lamb marinade spices. Pour over lamb and toss to coat well. Refrigerate for at least 8 hrs, up to overnight. 
3. Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a dutch oven over med high heat. Add lamb in batches and brown well, 5-7 mins. Set aside. 
4. In the same pot, add in oil and heat. Add onions and saute for 15 mins (or until slightly caramelized and browned). Add the minced garlic and spices. Saute until spices have bloomed and become fragrant. 
5. Add the beans (including liquid, if using). Add the lamb back into the pot. Mix with onions and spices until well incorporated. Begin layering cubed squash on top of beans. Add the dried prunes and nestle them in between the beans. Next, add the carrots and parsnips. 
7. Mix 1 cup of water (or broth), orange blossom water, and honey until combined. Pour evenly throughout the pot. 
8. Bring the pot to a simmer over med low heat. Continue cooking, covered, for about 20 mins. After, the squash and carrots should begin to become fork-tender and the prunes should become rehydrated and plump. 
9. Using a spoon, spoon out some liquid from bottom of pan and spoon it over the vegetables on top. If there is little liquid, add an addtl. 1/2 to 1 cup of water (or broth). Taste and adjust seasoning.
