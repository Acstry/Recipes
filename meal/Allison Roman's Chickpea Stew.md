### Ingredients:
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 2in piece ginger, chopped
- salt and pepper (to taste)
- 1 1/2 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp red pepper flakes
- 2 15 oz cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 2 15 oz cans coconut milk
- 2 cups veggie or chicken stock
- 1 bunch swiss chard, kale, or collard greens, stems removed and torn into bite-sized pieces
- Toppings: mint leaves, yogurt, pita or [[Garlic Naan]]

### Recipe:
1. Heat olive in a large pot over med heat. Add garlic, onion, and ginger. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally until onion is translucent and beginning to brown. 
2. Add turmeric, pepper flakes, and chickpeas. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, so the chickpeas sizzle and frey a bit until they start to break down a crisp lightly, 8 to 10 mins. Remove a cup of chickpeas and set aside for garnish. 
3. Using a wooden spatula, further crush remaining chickpeas slightly. Add coconut milk and stock, and season with salt and pepper. 
4. Bring to a simmer, scraping bottom of pot. Cook, stirring occasionally until stew has thickened, 30 to 35 mins, or until desired consistency. 
5. Add greens and stir, submerging them in liquid. Cook until wilted and softened. Season again with salt and pepper. 
6. Portion out, top with reserved chickpeas, mint, red-pepper flakes, and drizzle of olive oil. Serve with yogurt and pita.
