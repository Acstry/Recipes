### Ingredients:
- 1 cup orzo, cooked
- 3 ears of corn, husked
- ~8  green scallions
- 2 tsp avocado oil
- 5 garlic cloves
- Zest and juice of 1 med lemon
- 1 tbsp white wine vinegar
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1 tsp miso paste
- 1/4 cup fresh dill, stems removed
- 1 tbsp fresh oregano
- 12 oz edamame, thawed or cooked
- 1/3 cup marinated, jarred, artichoke hearts, roughly chopped
- 3 cups baby arugula
- 1/4-1/2 tsp red pepper flakes 
- Parmesan, grated (for garnish)

### Recipe:
1. Bring a med pot of water to a boil and generously salt the water. Cook the orzo until al dente according to package directions. Drain and transfer to a large mixing bowl. 
2. Heat a large griddle over med heat. When hot, place the ears of corn directly on the pan and grill for 10-12 mins, turning occasionally until corn is charred on all sides. Remove from heat and allow to cool. 
3. Trim and discard scallion roots, then cut the green portion of the scallions away from the white and set aside. Place the remaining white portion of the scallions onto the griddle to sear on both sides. As scallions are cooking, add the garlic cloves and avocado oil to one side of the pan and saute until fragrant. Set the scallions and garlic aside to cool. 
4. To a blender, add the sauteed garlic, 4 of the seared scallions, lemon zest and juice, vinegar, olive oil, miso paste, and 1/2 tsp salt. Blend on high until smooth and creamy. Add the dill, and blend again until fully incorporated. Season to taste. 
5. Once your corn is cool, cut the kernels off the cob, then thinly slice the remaining cooked and raw scallions. Add the corn, scallions, artichoke hearts, edamame, oregano, red pepper, and arugula to the orzo. Pour the dressing overtop, then give everything a mix until fully coated. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt or lemon juice as desired. 
6. Optionally top with parmesan, serve, and enjoy.
