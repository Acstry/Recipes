### Ingredients:
- 1 lb dry uncooked chickpeas
- 1 tbsp salt (this seems like a lot)
- 3/4 cup fresh parsley
- 1/2 cup fresh cilantro
- 1 large red onion, roughly chopped (reserve some for topping)
- 1 clove garlic
- 2 tsp cumin
- 2 tsp coriander
- 1 tsp black pepper
- Pita
- Serve with: [[Tzatziki]], hummus, tahini, chopped cucumber, chopped tomato, chopped red onion, chopped olives

### Recipe:
1. Cover the chickpeas with water in a med bowl. Set aside at room temp to soak for at least 12 or up to 24 hrs. They will double in size.
2. Drain the chickpeas. Rinse and dry them as thoroughly as possible.
3. Place the chickpeas and salt in food processor. Pulse to fine, pebble-sized pieces. Add the parsley, cilantro, onion, garlic, cumin, coriander, and black pepper. Blend until the mixture turns into a thick paste, scraping sides as needed. 
4. Heat olive oil in a skillet over med high heat. Scoop about 3/4 cup of falafel mixture onto pita. Cook falafel 5-7 mins or until falafel is browned and bread is crispy. Flip and toast on other side. 
5. Remove falafel from skillet, add toppings as desired, and serve.
