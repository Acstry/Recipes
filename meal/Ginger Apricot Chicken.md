### Ingredients:
- 2 1/2 lbs chicken thighs, boneless w/ skin
- salt and pepper (to taste)
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 4 tbsp water
- 4 tbsp apricot jam
- 2 tbsp rice vinegar
- 3/4 tsp ginger, grated
- 1 clove garlic, grated
- 1-2 thai red birds eye chilis, thinly sliced
- Scallions, sliced

### Recipe:
1. Lightly season chicken pieces with salt and pepper on both sides. Preheat cast iron skillet over med high heat. Meanwhile, whisk together next 7 ingredients and set aside. 
2. In hot pan, arrange chicken thighs skin-side down (no oil needed) in 2 batches to avoid overcrowding. Cook for 1-2 mins, or until fat has rendered out of skin, then lower heat. Continue cooking undisturbed for 8 mins or until skin is golden brown. Flip chicken over and cook other side for 3-5 mins or until cooked through. Repeat and set aside. 
3. Once all chicken is cooked, drain fat from the pan, leaving some to flavor sauce. Turn heat to low and pour sauce into the pan. Simmer gently to thicken slightly, scraping bottom with a wooden spoon. Return chicken to pan and coat on both sides with sauce. 
4. Serve over rice, and with a vegetable. Drizzle sauce from pan over top.
