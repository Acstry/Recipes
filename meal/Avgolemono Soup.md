### Ingredients:
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 5 cups water
- 1 lb skinless chicken thighs
- 1 small yellow onion, diced
- 1/2 leek, thinly sliced
- 3/4 cup rice
- 4 small celery ribs, thinly sliced, divided
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 2 lemons, juiced
- 1/2 lemon, zested
- 5 tbsp olive oil
- 2 bay leaves
- salt and pepper (to taste)

### Recipe:
1. In a large dutch oven, heat olive oil. Add onion and leek and saute until fragrant and translucent. Add 1/2 of the celery and saute 1-2 mins. 
2. Add chicken thighs to pot and add broth, water, salt, and bay leaves, and bring to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat and simmer for 30 min until the chicken can be easily shredded. 
3. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and shred. 
4. Add the chicken back to the broth along with the rice and other half of the celery. Simmer for 15-20 mins until the rice is completely cooked and very soft. 
5. In a med bowl, whisk the eggs, lemon juice, and lemon zest together until very frothy and thickened, this will take 2-3 mins. 
6. Next, temper the egg mixture. Very slowly, add a ladle of hot broth into the egg mixture one spoonful at a time, whisking to combine. Continue adding a spoonful of broth at a time until the egg mixture is hot, about 1/3 of the soup. 
7. Turn the heat off on the stove. 
8. Slowly pour the egg/broth mixture back into the soup pot and give it a good mix. Soup should be nicely thickened. 
9. Ladle into bowls and serve with olive oil, black pepper, and fresh dill. Serve.
