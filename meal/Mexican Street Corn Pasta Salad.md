### Ingredients:
- 2 cups ditalini pasta, or any small shape, cooked to package instructions, rinsed, and drained
- 3 cups fresh corn kernels, about 4-6 ears (or frozen corn, do not use canned)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 of a jalapeno, minced, seeds and ribs removed
- 1 bunch cilantro, finely chopped
- 1 bunch scallions, sliced
- 1/4 cup cotija cheese, crumbled
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1/2 cup mayo
- 2 chipotle peppers, canned & packed in adobo
- 1/3 cup fresh lime juice, and the zest of 1 lime
- Salt and pepper (to taste)

### Recipe:
1. Heat a large skillet over high heat. Drizzle with olive oil. Add the corn to the pan in one even layer. Add salt and pepper, and cover. 
2. Cook on high heat undisturbed until corn is nicely charred on the bottom. Remove lid, reduce heat, and add in garlic. Stir to combine and cook for an additional minute or two. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
3. In a blender, add the sour cream, mayo, chipotle peppers, lime juice, and lime zest. Blend to combine and add salt and pepper. Set aside. 
4. In a large bowl, add in the pasta, corn, jalapeno, cilantro, scallion, and cotija. Pour over dressing and toss to combine. Add additional salt and pepper, if needed. Serve.
