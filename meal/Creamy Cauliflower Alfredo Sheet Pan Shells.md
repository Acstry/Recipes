### Ingredients:
- salt
- 2 heads cauliflower, trimmed
- 4 cloves garlic, unpeeled
- 3 tbsp olive oil, divided
- pepper
- 4 sprigs fresh thyme
- 1/2 cup panko
- 2 oz parmesan, divided
- 12 oz pasta, such as shells
- 1 cup cottage cheese
- 1 cup milk
- 1 tbsp dijon mustard
- pinch cayenne
- 8 oz grated sharp white cheddar or gruyere, or a blend

### Recipe:
1. Heat oven to 435 degrees. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
2. Cut one of the heads of cauliflower into bite-sized florets. Transfer to a sheet pan along with the garlic cloves. Drizzle with 2 tbsp oil and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Toss to coat. Roast until tender, 20-25 mins. 
3. Slice remaining head of cauliflower into florets, Add to boiling water alongside thyme sprigs. Cook until very tender, 8-10 mins. Don't drain. 
4. Meanwhile, combine the panko, 1/2 cup of parmesan, remaining olive oil, and pinch of salt and pepper in a med bowl. Set aside.
5. When boiled cauliflower is finished, use a slotted spoon to transfer the florets to a food processor. Return water to a boil. Add pasta and cook according to package directions for al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water and drain. 
6. When cool enough to handle, squeeze roasted garlic out of their peels and add to the food processor. Add cottage cheese, milk, dijon, cayenne, and black pepper. Process until very smooth, about 1 min. 
7. Add 1 1/2 cups shard cheddar and remaining 1/2 cup parmesan and process again until smooth. Taste and season with salt, as needed. 
8. Return pasta and roasted cauliflower to the pot, add the sauce, and toss, adding a few splashes of pasta water until sauce evenly coats the pasta. Taste and season again. Heat broiler.
9. Transfer mixture to the now-empty sheet pan and spread into an even layer. Top with remaining cheese, followed by bread crumb mixture. Broil until bread crumbs are golden. Remove and serve.
