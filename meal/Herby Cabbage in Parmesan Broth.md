### Ingredients:
- 2 cups fresh parsley
- 1 med lemon, for zest and juice
- 1 head garlic
- 2 med shallots
- olive oil
- 5 sprigs fresh oregano
- 10 sprigs fresh thyme
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 parm rinds
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
- 1 med head of savoy cabbage
- 1 tbsp capers
- 2 tbsp  white wine vinegar
- black pepper (to taste)
- freshly grated parm (to serve)

### Recipe:
1. Begin by blanching the parsley. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Prepare an ice bath. Season boiling water with a pinch of salt. Submerge the parsley in boiling water for 30 secs, then use tongs to transfer to the ice bath.
2. Squeeze out excess water from parsley and finely chop. Transfer to a bowl. 
3. Grate 1/4 tsp of lemon zest into the parsley. Cut the top and bottom of the lemon off, making slices big enough to still hold a little juice. Set aside. 
4. Halve the garlic crosswise. Set aside bottom of garlic, and pop out cloves from the top to grate into parsley mixture. Set in fridge.
5. Remove top and bottom of the shallots and halve them lengthwise. Remove the green parts from the leek and halve the white part lengthwise.
6. Drain pot from parsley. Set back over med heat and coat the bottom with 1/4 cup olive oil. Allow to heat.
7. Place the center of the lemon, bottom of the garlic, shallots, and leek into the hot oil, searing all cut-side-down for 3-4 mins or until deeply golden brown. Flip and sear the other sides, making sure the lemon is caramelized on both sides.
8. Add the oregano, thyme, bay leaves, red pepper flakes, and parmesan rinds to the pot. Cover with 8 cups of water. Bring to a simmer and season with 2 tsp salt. 
9. Let this simmer for 60-90 mins to make broth. Longer is better.
10. When broth has 45 mins left, preheat oven to 425 degrees. 
11. Thinly slice the cabbage and add it to an unlined baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil, season with salt, and mix to coat.
12. Roast cabbage for 20-30 mins or until golden and crispy on the edges and softened in the center.
13. While cabbage is roasting, remove parsley mixture from fridge. Finely chop the capers and add them in, along with the juice from 2 lemon wedges, the white wine vinegar, a large pinch of salt, and a few cracks of black pepper. Drizzle in 3 tbsp of olive oil. Taste and adjust seasonings as desired.
14. When cabbage is done, pour parsley dressing all over it. Mix to coat.
15. Use a slotted spoon to skim all the ingredients out of the pot, leaving behind the broth. Taste and season with salt as needed.
16. To serve: Pile the herby cabbage in a bowl. Pour parmesan broth over top and grate on fresh parm. Serve warm.
