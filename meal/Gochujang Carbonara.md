### Ingredients:
- 4 egg yolks
- 1 lb any pasta
- 1/2 cup diced speck or pancetta
- 1 tbsp gochujang
- 1 cup freshly grated parmesan
- soy sauce
- reserved pasta water

### Recipe:
1. In a bowl, add the egg yolks, a few dashes soy sauce, gochujang, black pepper, and parm. Mix until a thick paste forms. 
2. Bring pasta to a boil in salted water and cook just until al dente. Reserve 1 1/2 cup pasta water.
3. In a large skillet or pot satue the speck in a bit of olive oil until golden and crisped. Remove from pan and set aside. Add al dente pasta to the pot along with 1/2 cup pasta water. Remove from heat.
4. Slowly stream the other 1/2 cup pasta water into your egg mixture, whisking to temper. 
5. Add egg mixture and speck into the pasta and mix to incorporate everything until a glossy sauce forms. If it's too thick, add 1 tbsp of pasta water a time to thin it. 
6. Top with more parm, speck, and black pepper.
