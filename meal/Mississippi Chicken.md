### Ingredients:
- 3-4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (could prob use thighs or whatev)
- 1 pkg ranch seasoning
- Salt and pepper (to taste)
- Maybe some garlic and paprika or something
- 1/2 jar banana peppers
- 1 stick butter, cubed
- 1/4 cup banana pepper juice
- 2 cups Monterey jack cheese

### Recipe:
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
2. Add chicken to a baking dish. Top with ranch packet and seasonings. Massage in. 
3. Layer remaining ingredients one on top of another. Cover dish with foil.
4. Bake for 30 mins. Remove foil and bake for additional 10 mins, until cheese is broiled and chicken is cooked through. 
5. This one might need some workshopping. People in the comments suggest searing the chicken first, maybe cube it if not using breasts. Someone added artichokes which sounds good.
