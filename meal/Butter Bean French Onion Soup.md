### Recipe:
1. Heat a skillet with 2 tbsp butter and olive oil. Add in onions and caramelize. Add salt and pepper (to taste).
2. When onions are caramelized, add 1 tbsp butter and flour. Stir. 
3. Add stock, beans, miso pasta, and thyme. Mix and allow to simmer at least 10 mins. Taste and adjust seasonings. (I like adding red pepper flakes, a bit of oregano, more salt, if i use chx broth sometimes I'll toss a beef bullion cube, cook with your heart).
