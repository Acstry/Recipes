### Ingredients:
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 large yellow onion, diced
- 1 1/4 cup water (if needed)
- 2 1/2 cups garlic cloves
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
- salt and pepper (to taste)
- 1 cup coconut milk
- 2 15oz can of butter beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 cup loosely packed curly parsley, finely chopped
- 1/2 lemon for juicing 
- 2 oz fresh parmesan
- 4-5 slices fresh bread of choice

### Recipe:
1. Prepare all mis en place. Recipe starts slow then moves quickly. 
2. Place a large high-sided skillet over med heat and add onion. Cook, stirring often, for about 5-6 mins to let the onion soften. If needed, add 1/4 cup of water so the onion can continue to cook without scorching. Cook another 6-7 mins or until the water has evaporated away.
3. Add in the garlic cloves and stir to coat in oil. Cook, undisturbed, for 4 mins, then give a few stirs and flip the cloves. Cook an addtl. 4 mins until the garlic cloves are golden all over. 
4. Add in 3/4 cup water and cover, letting garlic simmer for 15-17 mins, or until soft throughout. The onion might be pretty dark by now, don't worry, as the water will help loosen. 
5. When most of the water has cooked off, add in the red pepper flakes, nearly a tsp of salt, and a generous amount of black pepper. Stir the garlic, smashing most pieces with your spatula, until only a few remain whole. 
6. Pour in the coconut milk and stir again. It will become nice and thick, continue to smash garlic pieces as needed. Add 1/4 cup of water to thin it out, if desired. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Let simmer for a few mins.
7. Add in butter beans and swirl them into the garlic curry. Add the parsley and mix. Let this cook another few mins before removing from the heat.
8. Taste and add a squeeze of lemon if you'd like. Plate beans in bowls, adding a slice of crusty bread to each. Grate a heaping pile of parm on top and garnish with addtl. curly parsley. Serve.
