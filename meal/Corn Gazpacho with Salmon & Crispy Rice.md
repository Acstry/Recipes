### Ingredients:
- 1 cup white rice, cooked to pkg directions
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar
- 2 golden heirloom tomatoes, roughly chopped
- 1 yellow pepper, seeded and chopped
- 1 ear of corn, shucked and kernels removed
- 1 jalapeno, chopped up (optionally seeded)
- 1 lime
- 2 tbsp white wine vinegar
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 cup neutral oil
- 1 lb salmon
- salt and pepper (to taste)

### Recipe:
1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
2. When rice is down, drizzle in rice vinegar and stir. Then using a wet hand, press the rice into ring molds to form 1" high discs. Put in the freezer for 15 mins. 
3. Place the whole slab of salmon on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper and roast for 14-15 mins. 
4. In a large blender, add the tomato, bell pepper, corn kernels, jalapeno, and juice of lime. Add in vinegar and olive oil. Blend until a smooth soup is  achieved. If gazpacho is too thick, add 2 tbsp of ice water at a time, as needed, to help the blending process. 
5. Pour gazpacho into a bowl, season with salt and pepper, and add olive oil as needed. Set in fridge to chill. 
6. Bring a cast iron to med high heat. Fry frozen rice disks for about 2-3 mins on each side, or until golden brown. Set on paper towels to drain.
7. Remove salmon from the oven and flake it into large pieces. 
8. Add a serving of chilled gazpacho to bowl, crack crispy rice on top, then add salmon. Drizzle on olive oil and crack of black pepper to finish. Serve.
