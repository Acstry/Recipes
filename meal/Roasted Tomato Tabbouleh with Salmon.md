### Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups dry bulgur wheat
- 3 cloves garlic, smashed and peeled
- 2 tbsp white wine vinegar
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 tbsp honey
- 1/8 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp pepper
- 2 cups parsley 
- 1 pint cherry tomatoes
- 1 lb salmon
- 1 tbsp olive oil

### Recipe:
1. Add 4 1/2 cups of water to a large pot, add a small palm of salt to the pot, then the 1 1/2 cups of bulgur wheat. Bring this to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, and cover and simmer for 10 mins. Then remove from the heat and let it sit covered for 5 mins. Uncover and set aside.
2. In a jar, combine smashed garlic, vinegar, olive oil, honey, salt, and pepper in a jar. Shake vigorously until smooth. Remove garlic cloves, taste, and adjust.

4. Halve cherry tomatoes and portion salmon into 4 pieces. 
5. Put oven's broiler on high. Place salmon skin-side-down on a naked cast iron pan. Put these pans on med heat and let the salmon skin render out, about 4-5 mins. When the salmon is cooked about 1/2 of the way through, add in a dash of olive oil, then tomatoes around the edges of the salmon. Top the tomatoes with a generous squeeze of lemon juice. Immediately transfer this pan to oven middle rack. 
6. Broil salmon and tomatoes for 5-7 mins, or until salmon is golden on top and tomatoes are charred and bursting. 
7. Add parsley and burst tomatoes in with the bulgur wheat. Stir to combine and add the rest of the dressing as you prefer. Season with salt, pepper, and vinegar as needed.
8. Plate each bowl with tabbouleh, tomatoes, and top with a portion of salmon. Serve with addtl. dressing on side.
