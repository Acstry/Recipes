- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 4-5 garlic cloves, finely minced
- 2 tbsp cilantro, finely chopped
- 2 tbsp parsley, finely chopped

- tomato sauce, optional

### Recipe:
1. Slice the potato thin but do not cut all the way down, leaving about 1/4 to 1/2 inch at the bottom unsliced (when stuffed, the potato will make a V-shape). Repeat with remaining potatoes. 
2. Place all potatoes in a large bowl with salted warm water. Set aside. 
3. Prepare the filling. On med high heat, add olive oil to a pan. 
4. When hot, add the ground beef, garlic, parsley, cilantro, paprika, garlic powder, cumin, ginger, salt, and pepper. Using a wooden spoon, break apart meat and cook until no longer pink. 
5. Allow ground beef to cool. Can place in freezer, stirring every 10 mins until no longer steaming. Once cooled, add 2 eggs and stir to coat evenly. 
6. Drain water from potatoes and pat dry. Stuff each potato with ground beef filling. 
7. Prepare 3 bowls to dredge potatoes. One with flour. One with eggs. One with breadcrumbs. Dredge in flour and eggs, coat only meat-side with breadcrumbs. Repeat and set on lined baking sheet. 
8. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 
9. On med high heat, place a deep pan on the stove with enough oil to cover 1/4 of the embattan. Drop in when oil is hot enough to sizzle right away. 
10. Allow to get golden on each side before flipping. When both sides are done, transfer to a paper towel-lined plat to absorb excess oil. 
11. Set up a baking sheet with parchment paper. Optionally, dip in tomato sauce before placing on sheet. Place in oven and bake for 25 mins. 
12. Serve and enjoy.
