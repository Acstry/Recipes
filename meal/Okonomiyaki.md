### Ingredients:
Batter:
- AP flour (sugg. 2/3 cup)
- Cornstarch (sugg. 2tbsp)
- Eggs (sugg. 2)
- Water/Stock/Other Liquid (sugg. 1/2 cup)
NOTE: Batter is eyeball-able. It should be a slightly runny consistency like a thick pancake batter and vegetables should be well-coated but not drowning. The important thing is not to over-mix for a good texture. 
For the fillings, some kind of chunkier, crispier vegetable like cabbage or carrots is needed to be a good base but other toppings are totally up in the air.
