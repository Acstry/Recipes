### Ingredients:
- 2 1/2 lbs eggplant, trimmed
- 3 tbsp olive oil, divided
- 2 tsp salt, divided
- pepper (to taste)
- 1 16oz container cottage cheese
- 1/2 cup loose-packed fresh basil
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
- 8 oz low moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded
- 2 oz parmesan cheese, finely grated
- 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 1 24oz jar marinara sauce, divided

### Recipe:
1. Heat oven to 450 degrees. 
2. Slice the eggplant in half crosswise, then lengthwise into 1/4 in thick slabs, at roughly the same size.
3. Transfer to large mixing bowl and drizzle with 2 tbsp of oil. Season with 1 1/2 tsp salt and several grinds black pepper and toss to coat. 
4. Divide eggplant slices between two baking sheets and arrange into a single layer. Roast until knife-tender, 10-12 mins. 
5. Meanwhile, in the now-empty bowl, combine cottage cheese, basil, red pepper flakes, 1 1/2 cups mozzarella, remaining 1/2 tsp salt, and black pepper. 
6. In a separate smaller bowl, stir together parmesan, breadcrumbs, 1 tbsp oil, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. 
7. Combine roasted eggplant slices onto one sheet pan. On the now-empty sheet pan, spread 2 cups of marinara all the way to the edges. Arrange all eggplant slices over the top (can overlap slightly, if needed). Dollop on cottage cheese mixture, followed by remaining sauce. 
8. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella evenly over the sheet pan, followed by the breadcrumb mixture. Bake until sauce is bubbling and cheese is beginning to brown, 20-25 mins. Let sit at least 5 mins before topping with more basil. Serve.
