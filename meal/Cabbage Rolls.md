### Ingredients:
- 12 large green cabbage leaves
- 3/4 cup water
- 1 tsp butter 
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 cup long grain white rice
- 1 1/4 lbs lean ground beef
- 1 large egg, slightly beaten
- 1 large tart apple
- 1 small yellow onion, minced
- 1 large garlic clove, minced
- 1/3 cup chopped dill or 1 1/2 tbsp dried weed
- 2 tbsp chopped parsley
- Salt and pepper (to taste)
Tomato Sauce: 
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2 medium yellow onions, sliced
- 2 large garlic cloves, chopped
- 1 28 oz can crushed tomatoes, undrained
- 3 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp hot paprika
- 1 tsp worcestershire sauce

### Recipe:
1. Blanch cabbage leaves in boiling water for 3 mins, until limp. Drain and rinse under cold water. Drain and set aside.
2. In a small saucepan, bring water, butter, and salt to a rapid boil. Add rice, reduce heat, cover, and cook for 15 to 20 mins, until rice is tender and water is absorbed. 
3. In a large bowl, combine cooked rice, beef, egg, apple, onion, garlic, dill, parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix well.
4. Place cabbage leaves on a wooden board. Put 1/4 cup of beef mixture at the bottom of each leaf and roll, folding in the sides and completely enclosing the filling. Set filled leaves aside.
5. To make tomato sauce: In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onions and garlic, cook until onions are limp. Stir in remaining sauce ingredients and cook for 5 mins. Transfer half of the tomato sauce to a crock pot. Place the cabbage rolls, seam side down, in the sauce, making as many layers as necessary. Top with remaining sauce. Do not stir. Cover and cook (low 7 hours, high 3 1/2). 
6. Transfer cabbage rolls from crockpot, spoon sauce over top, and serve.
