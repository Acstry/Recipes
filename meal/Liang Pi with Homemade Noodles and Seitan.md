### Ingredients:
- 450g AP flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 250ml water
- 2.5L water
- 1/4 cup chili oil
- 2 tsp chinkiang vinegar
- 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tbsp sesame seeds
- 1 tsp sichuan pepper powder
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp msg
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 cucumber, julienned
- 1 cup bean sprouts, blanched

### Recipe:
1. Make a scrappy dough ball with the flour, salt, and 250 ml water. Rest, covered for 10 mins in a large bowl then knead into a smooth ball. Rest covered again for 30 mins, then cover with 3 cups of water and let sit for 5 mins. 
2. Squidge the dough ball around for 2 mins in a large bowl of water, squeezing as much starch out as possible, then reserve water. Repeat washing process 5-6 times until water becomes clearer, covering with 2 cups water each time, continuing to reserve starchy water. Dough may break apart during first few rounds, but it can be squished together.
3. Refrigerate seitan for a few hours, or overnight, covered.
4. Mix starchy liquid, then strain. Let water sit for 6-8 hrs, or overnight, allowing starch to settle. 
5. Steam seitan for 30 mins. Once cool, slice into small pieces.
6. Pour off most of the water from starch liquid, and keep the starchiest water and settled starch. Mix until smooth.
7. Mix 300g of starchy water with 2/3 cup water and a pinch of salt. Prepare a large tray of ice water.
8. Set up a steamer and use a small baking pan inside. Grease the pan with a little oil. Mix the starchy water well and ladle a thin layer into the pan, steaming for 1 1/2-2 mins. Brush the top with oil and gently move onto a greased plate. Repeat and slice noodles when cold. 
9. Mix next 10 ingredients together into a sauce. Add noodles, bean sprouts, coriander, a handful of seitan, and cucumber. Serve.
