### Ingredients:
Ricotta Filling: 
- 1 1/2 cup ricotta
- 1/3 cup grated parmesan
- salt and pepper, to taste
- dash of nutmeg
Soup:
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp unsalted butter 
- 1 tbsp minced garlic
- 1 lb 90/10 ground beef
- 1 1/2 tsp italian seasoning
- 1 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp red pepper flakes
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp oregano
- 1/2 tsp pepper
- 1/2 tsp salt, or to taste
- 24 oz jar marinara
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 4 cups beef broth
- 12 oz lasagna sheets, broken into pieces
- 2 tbsp parsley, finely chopped
- 1/4 to 1/3 cup grated parmesan
- 2 tbsp basil, chopped
- 1/3 cup shredded mozzarella
I subbed the nutmeg in the filling for black pepper and lemon juice (zest would be good too). And put the mozzarella on top instead of mixed in. Also cut out the heavy cream and it was fine. 

### Recipe:
1. For the Filling: To a small bowl, mix together all ingredients until smooth. Set aside. 
2. For the Soup: To a large pot over med high heat, add olive oil, butter, and garlic. Saute until fragrant, then add ground beef. 
3. Season with spices. Using a wooden spoon, break up meat. Mix and cook until meat is browned and broken up completely. 
4. Then add the marinara, heavy cream, and beef broth. Mix well and bring to a low boil. 
5. Add the lasagna sheets and cook 14-16 mins, or until pasta is fully cooked.
6. Add the basil, parsley, and mozzarella. Mix well. 
7. Serve warm in a bowl with dollops of ricotta on top.
