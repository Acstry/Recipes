### Ingredients:
For the Chicken: 
- 1 lemon
- 1 1/2 tbsp harissa paste
- 4 large, bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
- salt and pepper (to taste)
- 1 red onion, peeled and cut into 8 wedges
- 2 tbsp olive oil
For the Labneh:
- 4 heaped tbsp [[Labneh]]
- 4 chives, finely chopped
- Salt and pepper (to taste)
To plate: 
- 4 jarred roasted red pepper, cut into strips
- 4 chives, finely chopped
- 15 g toasted almonds
- Warm bread (to serve)

### Recipe:
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
2. Zest the lemon. Divide zest in half, into 2 small bowls. Cut the lemon into slices.
3. Add the harissa paste to bowl #1 and mix well. 
4. Pop the chicken thighs into a large bowl and add the lemon-harissa mix. Season with salt and pepper and stir well, until each piece is coated. 
5. Pop the onion wedges and chopped red peppers onto a baking tray and lay the lemon slices on top. Using tongs, place the chicken thighs on top, skin side up. Drizzle the whole tray generously with olive oil, then sprinkle with salt. 
6. Roast in the oven for 45-50 mins, or until the chicken is crispy and cooked through. Give the onions a stir after 20 mins, basting with the pan juices, to prevent burning. If any look close to burning, tuck them under the thighs.
7. Meanwhile, prepare the labneh: Place labneh in a bowl, add the chives and remaining zest. Season to taste with salt and pepper and mix well to combine. Set aside. 
8. To serve: spread the labneh onto a plate. Top with the red peppers, followed by the onions and lemon slices. Add the chicken thighs, then drizzle harissa juice from the pan on top. Sprinkle with chives, green onions, and toasted almonds. 
9. Serve with crusty bread and veggie side.
