### Ingredients:
- 2 blocks extra firm tofu, drained, rinsed, pressed, and cubed
- 2-15.5 oz cans of coconut milk
- 2-3 tbsp chili-garlic paste
- 2 limes, zested and juiced
- cooked white rice

### Recipe:
1. Add tofu to a large mixing bowl w/ 1 tbsp cooking oil, 1 tsp salt, and black pepper to taste. Toss together until all the pieces are evenly coated. 
2. Place a stainless steel or nonstick pan over med heat and allow to warm 2-3 mins, add 1-2 tbsp cooking oil to the pan and warm 15-20 secs. 
3. Add tofu to the pan and spread out evenly, allow to sear undisturbed for 5-6 mins, then begin flipping the pieces, continue to sear on the opposite side for another 3-4 mins. 
4. Remove the tofu from the pan, pour out any excess oil, then place the pan back over heat and immediately pour in the coconut milk. Add the chili-garlic paste, lime zest, lime juice, and 1/2 tsp salt, then stir together. 
5. Simmer for at least 5 mins. To make it smoother, use an immersion blender, if desired. 
6. Add the tofu back to the pan with the chili-lime coconut sauce and stir together. Continue to cook down until the sauce reaches your desired level of consistency. Season to taste.
7. Serve with a large scoop of white rice. Add tofu and sauce. Garnish with more lime zest, serve, and enjoy.
