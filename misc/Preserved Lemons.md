### Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup kosher salt
- 6 med lemons

### Recipe:
1. Wash 5 lemons well and cut them into halves. Leave tips intact and cut the halves into "quarters", spreading out the edges so that just the tip connects them. 
2. Add salt to a shallow dish and toss each lemon in the salt, using your fingers to coat the whole lemon in a thin layer of salt. 
3. Squeeze lemon pieces into a mason jar and press them down until they are completely covered in their own juice. Keep them compact and covered as possible.
4. Squeeze just the juice of the remaining lemon over the top. 
5. Put jar in the fridge, flip every week, will be ready in about a month.
