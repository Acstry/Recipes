### Ingredients:
- 1 5 lb bag of bread flour
- 6 cups of water
- 1 tbsp mushroom seasoning
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 2 tsp onion powder
- 8 cups vegetarian chicken broth 

### Recipe:
1. Add flour to large bowl. Slowly add water in cup measures and knead into dough. 
2. Move bowl to sink and knead the dough under running water. Strain away starch and milky water. Continue to knead and strain until water is clear.
3. Knead in seasonings and allow to rest for 1 hr. 
4. Stretch out the dough, then fold it together, and knot it around itself to add texture. 
5. Add 1/4 cup oil to a hot frying pan, and pan fry the knotted seitan dough. Cook until golden brown. 
6. Remove from pan and place inside a cheese cloth, wrapping tightly. 
7. Simmer the seitan in a very flavorful broth on low heat, or in an instant pot on slow cook low, for 12 hours. Allow to rest for 12-24 hours for a shreddy texture. 
8. Good in the fridge for 10 days or in the freezer for 6 months!
