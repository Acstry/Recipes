### Ingredients:
- 2 tsp active dry yeast
- 1 1/2 cups warm water
- 4 cups AP flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/3 cup olive oil

### Recipe:
1. Sprinkle yeast over warm water and set aside for 5 mins to allow the yeast to become foamy. 
2. In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. While stirring, drizzle olive oil into the flour mixture until it is fully combined. Flour mixture will be crumbly. 
3. Pour yeast into flour mixture and stir until dough forms. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for 5-10 mins, until dough becomes less sticky and develops some elasticity. 
4. Shape dough into a ball and place in a large mixing bowl coated in olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place to rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hrs, or until dough has doubled in size.
5. Punch down dough and divide as needed.
