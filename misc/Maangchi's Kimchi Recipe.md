- 1/2 cup salt
- 2 cups water
- 2 tbsp glutinous rice flour
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 2 cups daikon radish, in matchsticks

- 2 tsp ginger, minced
- 1 med onion, minced
- 1/2 cup fish sauce
- 1/4 cup saeujeot with brine, chopped
- 2 cups gochugaru

### Recipe:
1. Cut a short slit in the base of the cabbage then gently pull the halves apart. Cut slits in each half for later.
2. Dunk in a large basin of water to. Sprinkle salt between each leaf, using more salt closer to the stems. Let cabbage rest for 2 hours, turning every 30 mins and ladling salty water from basin over top of cabbages.
3. After 2 hours, wash the cabbage halves a few times under cold running water. Give them a good washing, to remove the salt and any dirt. As you wash, split the halves into quarters along the slits from before. Cut off the cores, give them a final rinse, and put them in a strainer. 
4. While cabbage is salting: Combine water and glutinous rice flour in a small pot. Mix well with a wooden spoon and let it cook over med heat for ~10 mins until it starts to bubble. Add sugar and cook 1 more min, stirring. Remove from the heat and let cool completely. 
5. Pour porridge into a large mixing bowl. Add garlic, ginger, onion, fish sauce, fermented salted shrimp, and hot pepper flakes. Mix well until mixture turns into a thin paste.
6. Add the radish, carrot, green onion, and chives. Mix well. 
7. In a large bowl, spread some kimchi paste on each cabbage leaf. When every leaf is covered, wrap it around itself into a small packet, and put into jar. 
8. The kimchi will start fermenting a day or two at room temp, depending on warmth of room. When fermentation begins, the kimchi will start to smell and taste sour and pressing down will cause bubbles to be released. 
9. Once it starts to ferment, store in the fridge to use as needed.
