### Ingredients:
- 1 cup whole milk greek yogurt
- heaping 1/4 tsp salt

### Recipe:
1. In a small bowl, mix together the yogurt and salt. 
2. Scoop the mixture onto a layer of cheesecloth. Bring the edges of the cheesecloth together, tie it around a wooden spoon, and place the spoon across the top of a med bowl so the labneh hangs but does not touch the bottom. Chill overnight. 
3. Remove the labneh from the cheesecloth. Transfer to a bowl and serve.
