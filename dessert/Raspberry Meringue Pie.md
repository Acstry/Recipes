### Ingredients:
- 1 premade or homemade pie crust
Curd Filling:
- 1 cup sugar
- 6 tbsp corn starch
- 6 egg yolks
- 1 egg
- 21 oz raspberries, fresh or frozen
- 2 lemons, zested
- 1/4 cup lemon juice
- 1 cup unsalted butter
- 1/4 tsp salt
Italian Meringue: 
- 1 1/2 cups sugar
- 5 tbsp water
- 6 egg whites (store in fridge)
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 tsp salt

### Recipe:
1. For the Filling: In a saucepan, whisk the cornstarch and sugar, with no lumps. Add egg yolks and egg. Whisk egg and sugar by hand briefly, until all yolks are broken up. 
2. Add raspberries, lemon juice, and lemon zest into egg mixture. Heat on med low, stirring constantly. 
3. Heat until simmers and thickens, ~10 mins. Mixture should be a thick porridge-like texture. Once thickened, add butter and salt and whisk to combine on low heat. 
4. Strain curd through a mesh sieve to remove seeds. Work in batches. 
5. Transfer warm filling into the cooked and cooled pie crust, smoothing top over. Press plastic wrap onto top of curd to avoid a film. Refrigerate until fully cooled and set, about 2-4 hours. 
6. For the Meringue: In a small saucepan, combine sugar and water and stir. Use a pastry brush moistened with water to brush down any sugar crystals off the sides of the bowl. Insert a candy thermometer into the saucepan. 
7. Let it come to a simmer on low heat. Once sugar dissolves, stop stirring. Bring to a soft ball stage, 235 degrees. While sugar syrup is heating, work on next step. 
8. Beat egg whites and 1 tsp lemon juice with the whisk attachment of a stand mixer until med peaks form. 
9. Slowly pour hot sugar syrup into the side of bowl while mixer is running on high speed. Add vanilla extract and salt while mixer is still running. Keep mixer on high speed, whisking until the egg whites increase in volume and bowl comes to room temp. 
10. Spread meringue over chilled and filled pie, starting with a thin layer, spreading it all the way to the crust, sealing in the filling. Pile the rest on top and make swoops with a spoon. 
11. Use a kitchen torch to toast meringue. You can also use the broil function in the oven.
12. Slice and serve immediately.
