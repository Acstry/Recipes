### Ingredients:
- 1 asian pear
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 1 1/2 tsp citrus juice
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1 pkg puff pastry
- vanilla ice cream

### Recipe:
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
2. Peel and slice the asian pear into 1/2" thick segments. Set aside. 
3. In an 8 or 10" oven-safe pan, add the sugar, citrus juice, and 2 tbsp of water and cook over medium heat. Swirl the pan consistently until the sugar melts and turns golden, ~10 mins.
4. Remove the pan from the heat and immediately toss in the butter and stir. 
5. Lay the pear slices down into the pan and arrange in one even layer, and add back to low heat. Cook until the pears soften, ~8 min. 
6. Cut the puff pastry to the size of the pan, lay over the top of the pears, and tuck in the edges. 
7. Bake in the oven uncovered for 20 mins at 375 degrees, or until the pastry is golden brown.
8. Remove, flip, and let cool for about 15 mins. Serve with flaky salt and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
