### Ingredients:
- 2 cups raw almonds
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 6 tbsp unsalted butter, room temp
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 2 tbsp orange blossom water
- 1 tbsp flour
- 2 tbsp water
- 1 1/2 cup honey
- egg roll papers
- neutral oil, to fry
- sesame seeds, to garnish, optional

### Recipe:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
2. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the raw almonds and boil for 1 min. Immediately after, drain water and run cold water over almonds. Slide almond between 2 fingers and the skin should pop off easily. Repeat skin removal with remaining almonds. 
3. Toss almonds in olive oil. Transfer to a lined baking sheet and bake for 20 mins or until just golden. Remove and set aside to cool.
4. To a food processor, add the almonds, butter, sugar, cinnamon, and orange blossom water. Grind until a smooth thick paste. Should not be crumbly or grainy. Portion out 1-2 tsp of dough onto a tray or parchment paper. 
5. Combine flour and water in a small bowl and mix well. 
6. Slice egg roll papers into long 2in wide strips. Keep sandwiched between damp napkins to prevent drying. 
7. Place a ball of almond paste at one edge of the egg roll paper strip. Fold small triangles tightly and, when at the last fold, add flour mixture to glue shut. Repeat.
8. Preheat oil in a large, shallow pan. Only need enough to cover half of each briwat. While oil is heating, add honey to a pot over low heat/simmer. 
9. Once oil is hot, add briwat. Allow to get golden brown on one side before flipping. Once both sides are cooked, use a slotted spoon to drain excess oil and transfer to honey mixture. Allow to sit in honey for 3 mins, pushing down to fully coat. Remove from honey and place on a plate or in a container. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, if desired.
10. Store at room temp in an air tight container, or store in fridge or freezer to store for an extended time.
