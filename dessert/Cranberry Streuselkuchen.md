### Ingredients:
For the Dough:
- 500g AP flour
- 10g instant yeast
- 50g sugar
- 250ml milk, lukewarm
- 80g butter, melted
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 tsp salt
For the Cranberry Topping: 
- 800g cranberries, fresh
- 4 tbsp maple syrup
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 4 tbsp water
For the Streusel: 
- 315g AP flour
- 225g sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 225g butter, softened

### Recipe:
1. For the Dough: Add the flour, yeast, and sugar to the bowl and whisk to combine.
2. Heat the milk until it is lukewarm (do not overheat or you will kill the yeast), pour it into the bowl, along with the eggs, melted butter, and salt.
3. Knead the dough with the dough hook attachment for at least 10 minutes, the dough should pull away from the edges of the bowl. It should be a very soft dough but not stick to your finger when poked.
4. Form the dough into a ball, place in a lightly greased bowl, and cover with plastic wrap or a proofing bag. Place somewhere warm and let rest for 30 min, the dough should double in size.
5. While the dough rests, make the cranberry topping and the streusel.
6. For the Cranberries: Pour 650 grams of the cranberries into a large pot, along with the maple syrup, water, and cinnamon.
7. Stir to combine and bring to a boil.
8. Once it starts to boil and the the cranberries begin to pop, reduce the heat to low and simmer the mixture until it becomes a thick, jam like consistency.
9. Remove the mixture from the heat and pour into a large shallow bowl, stir in the remaining cranberries and set aside to cool.
10. For the Streusel: In a medium bowl, add in the flour, sugar, butter, and vanilla.
11. Rub the butter into the dry ingredients with your fingers or a fork until it comes together into large crumbles.
12. To Assemble and Bake: Preheat the oven to 375 F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
13. After the dough has doubled in size, briefly knead it to knock out the remaining air.
14. Place the dough in the center of the lined baking sheet. Gently stretch the dough to all four sides and all four corners of the pan.
15. If the dough shrinks back, let it sit for 5 minutes and then continue stretching it.
16. Spread the cranberry mixture over the entire surface of the dough.
17. Sprinkle the streusel over the cranberries in large clumps, leaving a 1/2" border around all four edges, free from the streusel.
18. Bake for 30 min, rotating halfway through, until golden brown.
19. Once fully baked, remove the cake from the oven and set on a wire cooling rack to cool for at least 15 minutes before serving.
20. Gently slide the cake off of the pan and optionally drizzle it with a simple powdered sugar glaze before cutting into 12 or 24 equal servings.
