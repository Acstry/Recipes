### Ingredients:
- 1 cup warm water
- 2 tsp active dry yeast
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp neutral oil
- 1 3/4 cups AP flour
- 1/2 cup glutinous rice flour
- 2/3 cup brown sugar
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1/3 cup sunflower seeds

### Recipe:
1. Mix the brown sugar, cinnamon, and sunflower seeds together and set aside. 
2. Activate the yeast by combining with warm water and sugar. Set aside for a few mins. 
3. Add the salt and oil, mix. Add both flours. The dough should stick to your fingers. Cover and allow to rise for 1 hr, doubling in size. NOTE: if you don't have glutinous rice flour, you can omit it and use 2 cups AP flour. 
4. Knead the dough to release air, then cover again for another 30 mins. Allow to rise a little again. This time the dough should stick less to your fingers than the first time. 
5. On a floured surface, knead the dough once and form a ball. Cut into 8 pieces. 
6. Flatten each piece to about 5 in in diameter. Put between 1-2 tbsp of filling in the middle of each piece. Gather the edges of the dough together, pinching to seal. 
8. In a nonstick pan on med low heat, add enough oil to shallow fry the pancakes. Place them seam side down and fry until golden. Flip balls over and flatten with a solid spatula. Continue frying until both sides are golden brown. 
9. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Serve.
