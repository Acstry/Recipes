### Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups AP flour
- 1 1/2 cups ground hazelnuts
- 1 cup sugar, divided
- 3/4 cup cold butter, cubed
- 2 cups fresh blackberries
- 2 cups fresh blueberries
- 2 cups fresh strawberries, sliced
- 3 tbsp cornstarch

### Recipe:
1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, hazelnuts, and 1/2 cup sugar. Cut in butter until crumbly. Set aside 1 1/2 cups for topping. Press remaining crumb mixture onto the bottom and up the sides of an ungreased 9in deep dish pie plate. 
2. Place berries in a large bowl. Sprinkle with cornstarch and remaining sugar. Stir until well blended. Spoon into crust. Sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture. 
3. Bake at 375 degrees for 55-60 mins or until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly (cover edges with foil during the last 15 minutes). Cool on a wire rack and serve.
