Strawberry Cookie:

- 1/3 cup vegetable oil

### Recipe:
1. For the Cookies: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 
2. In a large bowl, combine strawberry cake mix, eggs, and vegetable oil. Combine with a rubber spatula until a dough forms. 
3. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop out dough in ~ 1/4 cup portions, spacing apart. 
4. Bake for 10-11 mins. Allow to cool to room temp. 
5. For the Crunch Topping: In a bowl, add all crunch topping ingredients and mix until a thick paste forms. 
6. On a lined baking sheet, combine the two doughs so they're swirled and not fully mixed. 
7. Spread in a flat and even layer and bake for 8-11 mins. Remove from oven and transfer to freezer to chill to room temp. 
8. When cool enough to handle, crumble with hands well. Set aside. 
9. For the Frosting: To a mixing bowl, add the cream cheese, unsalted butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract. 
10. Using a hand mixer, beat for ~2 mins until smooth and fluffy. Set aside. 
11. To Assemble: Take room temp cookies, frost with cream cheese frosting, and add strawberry crumble on top. 
12. Place in fridge to chill for 1 hour and serve.
