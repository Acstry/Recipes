### Ingredients:
- 16 tbsp salted butter
- 1/2 cup tahini
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 cups & 2 tbsp flour
- 6 tbsp cornstarch
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/8 tsp salt
- 2 tbsp white sesame seeds
- 2 tbsp black sesame seeds
- 1 tbsp large flake salt
- 1 tbsp cane or demerara sugar

### Recipe:
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. 
2. Leave 8 tbsp of butter out to soften. In a small saucepan, brown the other 8 tbsp of butter. Put a pan on med low heat and let butter fully melt. Stir occasionally, until you see milk solids start to separate and form flecks on the bottom of the pan. Let the butter fizz a bit and continue to stir. Cook low and slow for 3-4 mins, or until the milk solids start to become a golden brown. Remove the butter from the heat and stir until it is a deep, almost dark gold brown. 
3. Pour browned butter into a bowl and whisk to lower temp slightly. Add in tahini and whisk until smooth. 
4. In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the remaining butter, the brown butter/tahini mixture, 2 eggs, brown sugar, and white sugar. Beat on med low for 4-5 mins, or until mixture has lightened in color and is fluffy. 
5. While mixer is running, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.
6. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and use a spatula to form a dough. Put this in the fridge to chill for a few mins while you prepare the gomashio. 
7. Add the sesame seeds to a pan on med low heat and toast until white sesame seeds are golden brown. Using a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, lightly crush the seeds with flake salt and cane sugar to form gomashio coating. 
8. Scoop cookie dough into 1.5 oz balls and roll tops in gomashio.
9. Place the balls evenly on a parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 10-11 mins. 
10. Smack the baking sheet on the counter a few times to help flatten the cookies. Let cookies cool for 10-15 mins before eating, then enjoy.
