- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 3 tbsp milk
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 3 cups AP flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
Lemon Peach Syrup:
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1 1/2 cups water
- 1 lemon, juiced and zested
- 1/4 cup peach liquor or peach soju
- yellow food coloring, as needed

Filling and Assembly:

### Recipe:
1. For the Cookie Dough: In a stand mixer, combine sugar and eggs. Whip them together until thick, creamy, and lightened in color.
2. Add olive oil, milk, vanilla extract, and salt into the egg mixture and combine.
3. Sift the flour and baking powder into the wet ingredients and fold with a spatula until it forms a soft cookie dough. 
4. Pop cookie dough into the fridge for 1-2 hours. When chill, preheat oven to 355 degrees and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. 
5. Use a 2 tbsp cookie scoop to portion dough into 24 cookies. 
6. Roll portions into smooth balls between palms. If dough sticks to hands, moisten hands lightly with a bit of water. 
7. Place dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving 2 in of space between each cookie. 
8. Bake for 11-12 mins. Ready when the bottoms are golden brown. 
9. As soon as cookies are cool enough to touch, use a small sharp knife to cut out centers of cookies from the bottom. Do while warm or cookies may break. 
10. For the Syrup: Combine sugar and water in a med saucepan. Add in lemon zest and juice.
11. Heat on med heat until syrup comes to a boil, then remove from heat. 
12. When room temp, remove lemon zest. Add in peach liquor and mix to combine. 
13. Divide syrup between 2 bowls. Add red food coloring to one and yellow food coloring to other. Syrup should be brightly colored. 
14. For Assembly: Add peach curd into each half. Sandwich cookies together and repeat. 
15. Quickly (to avoid cookie getting soggy) dip half the cookie into red syrup, and other half into yellow syrup. 
16. Place cookie onto tray and sprinkle with sugar on all sides. Place a leaf on top of each cookie before serving.
