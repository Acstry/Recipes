### Ingredients:
For the Lemon Lavender Sugar:
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 tsp dry lavender, ground
- 1/2 tbsp lemon zest
For the Cookies: 
- 2 1/2 cups AP flour
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 1/2 tbsp lemon zest
- 1 tbsp dry lavender, ground
For the Lemon Icing: 
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar
- 1-2 tsp lemon juice

### Recipe:
1. For the Sugar: Mix the sugar, lemon zest, and lavender together in a small bowl. Set aside. 
2. For the Cookies: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper and set aside. 
3. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Then set aside. 
4. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar together with an electric mixer on high speed until fluffy, about 2 mins. 
5. Add in the egg, vanilla, lemon zest, and lavender and mix on med speed until pale in color and fluffy, 1-2 mins. 
6. Slowly add in the dry ingredients. Mix on low speed just until dough pulls together: 
7. Scoop the dough into balls with a small cookie scoop. Roll into balls, then roll in lemon lavender sugar. 
8. Place the dough onto the prepared baking sheet and slightly flatten each ball. 
9. Bake the cookies for 8-9 mins. Let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 mins, then transfer them to a cooling rack.
10. For the Icing: In a small bowl, mix powdered sugar and lemon juice together until a thick glaze forms. It should drizzle off a spoon easily, but not be runny. 
11. Once cookies are cooled, drizzle icing over them. Allow icing to harden and then enjoy.
