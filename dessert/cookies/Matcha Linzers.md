### Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 sticks butter, softened
- 2/3 cup sugar
- 1 tsp cardamom
- 1 egg yolk
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 cups AP Flour
- 2/3 cup almond flour 
- 1/2 tsp salt 
- strawberry preserves (for filling)
Matcha ganache (for filling)
- 1 cup white chocolate chips
- 1/4 cup plus 1 tbsp heavy cream
- 1 1/5 tsp matcha
Strawberry and matcha sugar (for dusting)
- 1-1 1/2 tsp matcha
- 1/4 cup freeze dried strawberries
- 3/4 cup powdered sugar, divided

### Recipe:
1. For the cookies: In a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, add the butter, cardamom, and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg yolk and vanilla and continue to beat until combined. 
2. In a separate bowl, mix the salt, AP flour, and almond flour until combined. Add to the butter and mix until just incorporated. Mixture will be rather crumbly. 
3. Divide dough ball into two discs, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1 hr. 
4. To make the matcha ganache: Bring heavy cream to a simmer in a small sauce pot. Add matcha and whisk to combine until no clumps remain. Add white chocolate chips to a small bowl and pour heavy cream over the chocolate. Let set for 1-2 mins then whisk until the chocolate is fully melted. Refrigerate for 30 min, or until set. Once set, whip with a fork for 3-5 mins. 
5. To make the matcha sugar: Add matcha to 1/2 cup powdered sugar. Mix until well incorporated.
6. To make the strawberry sugar: Pulse freeze-dried strawberries and add 1/4 cup powdered sugar. Adjust ratio to desired flavor. 
7. To form the cookies: Take the dough out of the refrigerator and allow to sit 5-10 min, until soft enough to roll. On a floured work surface, roll dough until 1/8" thick. Use a scalloped cookie cutter to make 2" wide cookies. Move them to a parchment lined baking sheet and repeat with dough scraps, should make about 30 cookies. If dough becomes too warm and sticky, place back in fridge ~15 mins until firm. Use a smaller circle or heart cookie cutter to cut out center of half the cookies.
8. Chill cookie rounds in fridge for about 30 mins then bake at 350 degrees for 13-15 mins, or until edges begin to turn slightly brown. Allow to cool about 10 mins. Transfer to a cooling rack and cool completely before filling. 
9. To assemble: Flip the cookies with no holes in them, upside down and spread a small dollop of ganache to half and strawberry jam to other half. If the ganache needs to be softened, microwave in 10 sec intervals. 
10. For the heart-stamped cookies, sift half of the tops with matcha sugar and half with strawberry sugar. Top matcha ganache cookies with strawberry tops and vice versa, pressing cookies together lightly.
