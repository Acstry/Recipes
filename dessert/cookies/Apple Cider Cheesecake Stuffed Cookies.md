### Recipe:
1. Add apple cider to a med saucepan. Bring to a simmer over med low heat and let simmer until reduced to 2 tbsp. Cider will be very very thick. Be sure to really watch for the last 5 mins, to avoid burning. Let cool. 
2. For the filling: Line a small cookie sheet with parchment paper. 
3. Add cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla to a small bowl. Mix on med high speed with an electric mixer until fully and sugar has dissolved. 
4. Scoop cheesecake filling into 16, 2 tsp portions onto the baking sheet.
5. Pop balls into freezer until they are frozen and firm. 
6. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. 
7. In a med bowl, whisk together flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Then set aside.
8. In a large bowl, cream butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together with an electric mixer on high speed until fluffy.
9. Add in the egg yolks, vanilla, and reduced apple cider and mix on med speed until pale and fluffy and cider has incorporated. Reduced cider will be thick and sticky, it only matters that most of it is blended in. 
10. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients, and combine on low speed until just combined. 
11. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough chill in the fridge for 15-20 mins. 
12. Scoop the dough into 16 portions with a 1 1/2 tbsp cookie scoop. Slightly flatten out each dough ball, then place the frozen cheesecake ball in the center. Then close cheesecake ball in with cookie dough and roll into a ball again. Make sure the cheesecake is completely covered in cookie dough. 
13. Transfer cookie balls to a prepared baking sheet. Bake 6 cookies at a time for 11-12 mins. 
14. Let the cookies cool for 15 mins on the cookie sheet, then transfer the baked cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
