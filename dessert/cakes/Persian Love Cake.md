### Ingredients:
Cake
- 1/2 cup salted butter, room temp
- 3 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 tsp lemon zest
- 2 tsp lemon juice
- 2 tbsp rose water
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 cups AP flour
- 1/2 cup almond flour
- 2 tsp ground cardamom
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 3/4 tsp salt

Glaze
- 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar
- 1 tbsp rose water
- 1 1/2 tbsp whole milk
- 1/4 cup chopped pistachios
- 3 tbsp rose petals
- 2 tbsp candied ginger (optional)

### Recipe:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line an 8" cake pan with parchment paper and set aside. 
2. In a stand mixer with paddle attachment: cream butter, oil, eggs, and sugar until light and fluffy. Add in lemon zest, lemon juice, rose water, and vanilla extract. 
3. Turn speed to low and add in flour, almond flour, cardamom, baking powder, and salt until just mixed.
4. Pour batter into prepared cake pan. Bake for 40 mins, or until cake is lightly brown on top and knife comes out clean. Allow to cool before glazing. 
5. For the glaze: combine powdered sugar, rose water, and whole milk in a microwave-safe bowl and whisk to combine (glaze will be very thick). Microwave for 10-15 seconds to thin out mixture, then pour over cooled cake.
6. Sprinkle on crushed pistachios, rose petals, and candied ginger (if using). Serve.
