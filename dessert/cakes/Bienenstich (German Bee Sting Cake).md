### Recipe:
1. For the Dough: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together the flour, sugar, and yeast. 
3. Add in the milk, butter, egg, yolk, and salt. 
4. Use the dough hook attachment to knead the dough on med low speed for 10 mins. It should be smooth but still stick to the bowl. 
5. Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover with a towel. Allow 30 mins in a warm place for dough to proof until doubled in size. 
6. Grease a 9x13 baking pan. Knock the air from the dough and place in the center of the pan. Gently stretch it out from the center. 
7. For the Topping: Heat over med high heat, stirring frequently, until it comes to a boil. Continue cooking for 1 min longer, then remove from the heat. 
8. Stir in the almonds and cinnamon. 
9. To Bake: Continue stretching until dough reaches the edges of the pan. If it shrinks, let it rest for 5 mins and then continue stretching. 
10. Spoon the topping onto the dough around the edge of the rectangle. Use a rubber spatula to spread topping evenly over dough. 
11. Immediately, bake in the oven for 20-22 mins, rotating pan halfway through. Cake is done when it has become a deep golden brown color. When finished, remove and place on a wire rack to cool. 
12. For the Filling: In the bowl of a stand mixer, pour in the heavy cream. 
13. Sprinkle instant vanilla pudding mix over the cream and use the whisk attachment to whip it to stiff peaks on high speed. 
14. To Assemble: Once cake is cooled, loosen from baking pan and gently tip out and place it face up on a cutting board. 
15. Cut cake into 12 slices by first cutting it in half lengthwise and then crosswise, then cutting each quarter into 3 slices. 
16. Cut each slice in half so that you have two layers. 
17. Use a piping bag or offset spatula to spread the cream filling onto the bottom layer of each slice of cake. 
18. Lay top layer of each piece over filling and press gently. Serve.
