### Ingredients:
Crust: 
- 4 heaping cups Nilla wafers
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 2 tbsp sugar
Cheesecake: 
- 32 oz cream cheese, room temp
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 2 tbsp corn starch
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract
- 1/3 cup sour cream, room temp
- 8 oz white chocolate, melted
- 3 eggs, room temp
- 3 egg yolks, room temp
Vanilla Cream: 
- 1 1/2 cups milk
- 4 egg yolks
- 3/4 cup sugar
- pinch of salt
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract
- 1 tbsp + 1tsp cornstarch
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter, cut in cubes
- 1/4-1/3 cup sugar (for brulee topping)

### Recipe:
1. Prepare 9 in springform pan by wrapping the bottom and sides of it with tinfoil. Make sure foil goes up 2 in on sides of pan so no water seeps in as it bakes. Spray sides with non-stick spray and line bottom with parchment paper.
2. Pulse Nilla wafers in a food processor until finely ground. 
3. Add in the melted butter and sugar and pulse to combine. 
4. Press crumbs into the bottom and about an inch up the sides of the pan. 
5. Bake crust for 10 mins and then let it cool completely while working on cheesecake batter. 
6. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
7. In the bowl of a stand mixer, mix cream cheese, sugar, and cornstarch together with a paddle attachment for 2 mins on med speed until everything is smooth. Scrape down sides and bottom of bowl to ensure everything has been mixed.
8. Add in vanilla, sour cream, and melted and cooled white chocolate and mix for 1 min on med speed. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl again. 
9. At this point, stop and put a pot of water on the stove to start boiling. You will want enough water to go about 1 1/2 inches up the sides of the springform pan. 
10. Next add in the eggs and yolks one at a time to the cheesecake batter. Mix on low, ensuring each is fully mixed before adding the next. As soon as the last is fully mixed, turn off mixer. Do not over mix. 
11. Pour batter into prepared pan with crust. 
12. Place cheesecake in a large roasting pan in the oven. Slowly pour boiling water into pan around cheesecake, being careful not to splash. 
13. Bake for 1 hr. When hour is up, turn off oven and crack oven door open using a wooden utensil. Let the cheesecake stay in oven for 1 more hr. Cheesecake will continue to bake as it is cooling.
14. Once 2 hrs are up, remove from oven and go around edges of pan with a butter knife to loosen crust. Let cheesecake cool completely on the counter, then refirgerate until completely cold, 8 hrs or overnight. 
15. While cheesecake is cooling, make pastry cream. In a med saucepan, heat milk over med low heat just until steaming. Then, turn heat down to low until ready to use. 
16. To a large bowl, add egg yolks, sugar, salt, vanilla, and cornstarch and whisk until combined and a pale-yellow color. 
17. Add in 1/4 of the heated milk while stirring vigorously. Then add the rest in and stir to combine. 
18. Transfer mixture to saucepan. Heat over med low heat and cook for 8-12 mins, whisking continuously, until the mixture is thick and soft peaks form. 
19. Remove pastry cream from heat and transfer to a bowl. Add in the butter and mix to combine. Place plastic wrap right on top of the pastry cream to prevent skin form forming. Chill in fridge until completely cold. 
20. When cheesecake has chilled, remove from pan and transfer to serving plate. Spread pastry cream evenly on top of cheesecake. 
21. Sprinkle 1/4-1/3 cup sugar over pastry cream. Use a kitchen torch to brulee the sugar until it is golden brown. Let topping cool for about 10 mins. Serve.
