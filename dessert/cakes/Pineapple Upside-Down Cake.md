### Ingredients:
- 2 8oz cans pineapple slices in juice
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 8 tbsp butter, softened
- 1 cup cake flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 2/3 cup sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/3 cup milk

### Recipe:
1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Drain pineapple slices in sieve set over bowl. Reserve 2 tbsp juice. Cut 8 slices pineapple in half and dry on paper towels. Refrigerate remaining slices.
2. In 10 inch over-safe skillet, heat brown sugar and 2 tbsp butter over medium heat until melted. Stir in reserved pineapple juice and bring to a boil, boil for 1 min. Remove skillet from heat. Decoratively arrange pineapple in skillet, overlapping slices slightly to fit. 
3. In small bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt. In large bowl, with mixer at high speed, beat remaining 6 tbsp butter and granulated sugar until fluffy, frequently scraping bowl with rubber spatula. Reduce speed to low, beat in egg and vanilla until well blended. Add flour mixture alternately with milk, beginning and ending with flour mixture. Beat just until blended.
4. Spoon batter over pineapple, spread evenly with rubber spatula. Bake until toothpick comes out clean, 40-45 minutes. Run thin knife around skillet to loosen cake. Serve warm.
