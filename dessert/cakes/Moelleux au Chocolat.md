### Ingredients:
- 1 cup unsalted butter, cut into cubes
- 1 cup 70% dark chocolate, roughly chopped
- 3/4 cup cocoa powder
- Pinch of salt
- 7 large eggs
- 1 1/3 cups sugar

### Recipe:
1. Preheat oven to 355 degrees. Generously butter a 9in round springform tin with butter and line the base with baking paper. Set aside. 
2. In a microwave, in 30 sec intervals, melt the butter and chocolate together in a bowl, stirring frequently. 
3. Once you've got a smooth, glossy mixture, pop a sieve over the bowl and sift in the cocoa powder and salt. Stir until smooth. Set aside. 
4. Separate the eggs, putting the whites into the bowl of a stand mixer and the yolks into another large bowl.
5. Add 1/2 the sugar to the egg yolks and whisk using an electric mixer for about 2 mins, or until pale, light, and thick. 
6. Meanwhile, in the stand mixer, whisk the egg whites until you have soft peaks. Gradually add the remaining sugar, whisking until egg whites are stiff and glossy.
7. You should now have 3 bowls that need to be mixed together. First, pour the melted chocolate mixture into the egg yolks and stir gently. Then add two spoons of whisked egg whites into the chocolate mixture and stir quite vigorously so it is well incorporated. 
8. Next, gently fold in the remaining egg whites, taking care to keep in as much air as possible. You shouldn't see any of the egg whites after you've folded it together. 
9. Pour 2/3rds of the cake batter into the prepared tin and bake for about 25 mins - or until the cake is well risen, puffy, and a skewer comes out clean. Leave to cool completely in the tin. 
10. Meanwhile, pour the remaining 1/3rd of the cake batter into a med bowl and set aside in the fridge. 
11. Preheat the oven, to 355 degrees, and line a baking tray with baking paper. Set aside. 
12. Once the cake has cooled completely, remove from the tin and place on the baking tray. Spread the reserved 1/3rd of the cake batter on top of the cake. 
13. Bake the cake for 10-15 mins or until you see a thin crust on top but the middle is still soft. Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 mins. 
14. Cut into slices and serve warm with heavy cream, ice cream, or custard.
