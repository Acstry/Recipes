### Ingredients:
Sponge: 
- 4 large eggs, separated
- 2/3 cup sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1 cup AP flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- Pinch of salt
For the Coffee Soak: 
- 2 tbsp instant coffee, mixed with 4 tbsp boiling water, left to cool
- 3/4 cup sweetened condensed milk
- 2 tbsp heavy cream
For the Topping:
- 3/4 cup heavy cream
- 1/4 cup powdered sugar, sieved
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 cup mascarpone, at room temp
- Cocoa powder, to dust

### Recipe:
1. Preheat oven to 320 degrees. Grease and line a 9in square tin with baking parchment. 
2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk the egg whites with an electric mixer until soft peaks. Gradually add half of the sugar a spoonful at a time, whilst continuing to whisk. Once all the sugar has been added and the meringue has formed stiff peaks, set aside. 
3. In a separate large bowl, whisk the yolks with the remaining sugar and vanilla extract until pale and thickened. Add the milk and whisk for about 30 sec to combine. 
4. Sift in the flour, baking powder, and salt. 
5. Slowly and gently fold in the meringue a little at a time - keeping in as much air as possible. 
6. Pour into the lined tin and tap gently to get rid of air bubbles. Bake for about 35 mins - or until the sponge is lightly golden and skewer comes out clean. Leave to cool for 10 mins. 
7. Meanwhile, make the coffee soak: whisk together the coffee, condensed milk, and cream. Set aside. 
8. Use a skewer to make holes across the surface of the warm sponge. Pour over hald of the coffee soak. Wait for it to be absorbed before pouring over remaining mixture. Cover and chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours - ideally overnight.
9. When ready to serve, prepare the topping: Whisk the heavy cream with the powdered sugar and vanilla extract until you have soft peaks. Fold in the mascarpone. 
10. Remove the cake from the tin and set onto a flat plate. 
11. Using a palette knife or back of a spoon, spread on top of the chilled cake. Dust liberally with cocoa powder. 
12. Serve straight away or chill until ready to serve.
