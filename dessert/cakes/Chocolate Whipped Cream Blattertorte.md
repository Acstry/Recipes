### Ingredients:
Dough:
- 250g AP flour
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 30g sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 150g creme fraiche
- 175g butter, softened
Streusel:
- 150g AP flour
- 100g sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 100g butter, softened
Plain Whipped Cream:
- 500ml heavy whipping cream, cold
- 30g powdered sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
Chocolate Whipped Cream:
- 750ml heavy whipping cream, cold
- 40g powdered sugar
- 60g cocoa powder
- 100g mini chocolate chips

### Recipe:
1. Preheat the oven to 400 F.
2. For the dough and streusel: In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine flour, sugar, and baking powder. Whisk until fully combined.
3. Add in the crème fraîche, butter, and vanilla extract. Use the dough hook attachment to knead on low speed until fully mixed. Then turn the mixer to high speed for 7-10 more minutes until the dough no longer sticks to your finger.
4. While the dough is kneading, make the streusel. Combine the flour and sugar in a medium mixing bowl and stir to combine. Then add in the butter and vanilla; rub the butter into the flour and sugar, between your fingers until clumps of streusel are formed.
5. Once the dough is finished kneading in the machine, dump it out onto a clean work surface. Knead it by hand until the dough stops tearing apart and getting stuck to the counter – about five minutes.
6. Divide the dough into four equal portions. Lightly grease a 9" springform pan.
7. To Bake: Starting with one portion of the dough, place it in the bottom of the springform pan and gently press the dough towards the outer edges of the pan using your fingers. Try not to rip the dough and make sure that it is an even thickness all the way to the edges.
8. Top the layer of dough with 1/4 of the streusel mixture and bake for 15 minutes until golden brown.
9. Immediately after taking the pan out of the oven, remove the layer from the pan and place it on a cutting board. Cut it into 8 slices and leave to cool for five minutes before transferring to a wire cooling rack.
10. Repeat these steps until you get to the last portion of dough. The fourth piece should be baked in the same way as the previous layers but not cut after it is done baking.
11. Allow all the layers to cool before proceeding to the assembly.
12. For the Filling: For the plain whipped cream, add the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract to the bowl of a stand mixer.
13. Using a whisk attachment, whip the cream until stiff peaks form. Transfer the vanilla cream into a bowl and place it in the fridge while you make the chocolate whipped cream.
14. To make the chocolate whipped cream, follow the same steps as for the vanilla whipped cream but add in the sifted cocoa powder when adding the powdered sugar.
15. To Assemble: Once all of the layers are cooled, pick the dish/ surface that you want to serve the torte on – this is what you should use to assemble it.
16. Start with the uncut layer. Fill a piping bag with both the chocolate and vanilla whipped cream and pipe on a layer of kisses with the marbled whipped cream. Sprinkle with 1/3 of the mini chocolate chips.
17. Then add the next cookie layer and repeat the layering of whipped cream and chocolate chips. When adding the third and fourth cookie layers, make sure to line up the cut slices with the second cookie layer.
18. Once the last cookie layer has been added, top each slice with one more kiss of whipped cream.
19. Place the entire cake in the fridge for at least 1 hour and then sprinkle with powdered sugar to serve.
