### Ingredients:
For the Batter:
- 150g AP flour
- 50g whole wheat flour
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 200g sugar
- 150g butter, soft
- 100g yogurt, room temp
- 3 eggs, room temp
- 1 lemon, zested
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 tsp almond extract
For the Plums:
- 5-6 small plums
- 30g AP flour
- 2 tbsp sugar
For the Whipped Cream:
- 150ml heavy cream, cold
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 tsp salt

### Recipe:
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and place a rack in the center of the oven.
2. For the Batter: In a medium bowl, pour in the granulated sugar and lemon zest. Use your fingers to rub the zest into the sugar until it becomes fragrant and the sugar starts to clump. Then add in the butter, vanilla extract, almond extract, and salt and use a rubber spatula to stir together.
3. Add in the eggs one at a time, using a whisk to incorporate them into them into the butter mixture.
4. Then add in the yogurt and whisk once more.
5. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and then pour in both flours, baking soda, and baking powder. Swap back to a rubber spatula and stir to combine. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.
6. Line a 9" springform pan with parchment paper or grease with a baking spray. If you don't have a springform pan, a standard cake pan will work as well.
7. To Assemble: Pour the vanilla batter into the lined pan. Use a rubber or offset spatula to level the cake across the top.
8. Wash and cut the plums in half, then remove the stones. Add 30 grams of all purpose flour into a small bowl.
9. Dip each half of a plum, skin side down into the flour, then place as close together as possible onto the cake. Be sure to cover the skin surface as much as possible but not the cut open side.
10. Sprinkle the top of the cake and plums with three tablespoons vanilla or plain granulated sugar. Place the cake in the fridge for 5 minutes.
11. Then bake the cake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Rotate the cake 180 degrees and bake for another 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Try to insert the toothpick into the center without sticking it right through one of the plums.
12. Once the cake is finished baking, let it cool for 10 minutes before running a knife along the edge of the cake to loosen it from the pan. Release the spring form and remove the cake from the pan to cool for at least 20 more minutes.
13. For the Whipped Cream: In a large mixing bowl, pour in the heavy cream and granulated sugar followed by two teaspoons of vanilla extract.
14. Scrape out the insides of a vanilla bean pod and add it into the bowl as well. Alternatively add a teaspoon of vanilla bean paste or grind up a dried out vanilla bean.
15. Use a whisk or an electric mixer to beat just until soft peaks form. If you over beat it but it hasn't yet turned into butter, simply pour in some un-whipped cream and use a spoon or rubber spatula to fold it into the stiff cream.
