### Ingredients:
- [[Olive Oil Cake Batter]]
- 228 grams salted butter
- 450 grams powdered sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 tbsp heavy cream

### Recipe:
1. Bake olive oil cake base and remove from oven, allowing to cool to room temp. 
2. While cake is baking, place butter into a sauce pot. Place over med low heat and let butter melt, then bubble, then go silent. Once it quiets, begin to stir regularly until it begins to brown. 
3. Once browned, pour butter into a heat safe mixing bowl and leave to cool to room temp. Butter should become softened, not soup. If it isn't firming up, place in fridge, stirring occasionally until its spreadable. 
4. Sift the powdered sugar into the butter and add vanilla extract. Use mixer to whip until fully combined and smooth. Add in 1 tbsp of heavy cream at a time until the buttercream is soft and spreadable and no longer super stiff. 
5. If too much cream is added, sift in more powdered sugar until desired texture is reached. 
6. When cake has cooled and buttercream is whipped, scoop frosting on top of cake.
7. Use the back of a spoon to swirl frosting into desired design, or use scraper to smooth out edges. Serve.
