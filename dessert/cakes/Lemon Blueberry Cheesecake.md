### Recipe:
1. For the blueberry sauce: Combine blueberries, sugar, cornstarch and cinnamon in a saucepan.
2. Cook on low heat, stirring well. Mash blueberries roughly with a spatula. Once it starts to bubble and becomes thick, remove from heat and set aside to cool. 
3. For the crust: Preheat oven to 355 degrees. Grease a 9" round springform pan with butter. 
4. Combine graham crumbs, brown sugar, melted butter, and salt in a large bowl. Mix together well to combine. 
5. Transfer mixture into the springform pan and press into the sides and bottom tightly with a glass. 
6. Place pan onto a baking sheet and bake for 8 mins. Remove from the oven and set aside until cooled. Reduce oven to 300 degrees. 
7. For the batter: In a stand mixer, combine cream cheese, sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Mix with a paddle attachment until smooth and creamy. Scrape down the side and mix again to ensure everything mixes evenly. 
8. Add one egg into mixture. Mix until just incorporated, and scrape down bowl. Repeat with remaining eggs, making sure to blend in and scrape before next egg. Don't overmix. 
9. Add vanilla extract and sour cream to batter. Mix until just incorporated. 
10. Transfer half cheesecake batter into a separate bowl. Add about 3/4ths of the blueberry sauce and mix until an even purple color. 
11. In other bowl, add lemon zest and juice. Add food coloring, if using. Mix until batter is smooth and even. 
12. Add large scoopfuls of batter into crust, alternating blueberry and lemon batters. Continue until batter is used up. 
13. Then, add spoonfuls of the remaining blueberry sauce on top. Use a knife to swirl batter and sauce gently. 
14. Bake cheesecake on baking tray for 1 hr 10 mins. Cheesecake is ready when the middle is puffed up and jiggly, but not liquid. 
15. Remove from the oven and allow to cool to room temp for at least 6 hrs to overnight. 
16. Before serving, remove from pan by running a knife along the edge and releasing outer ring. 
17. For the garnish: Combine whipping cream, sugar, and vanilla in a med chilled bowl. Whip to med peaks with a wire whisk. Add greek yogurt and whip until it reaches stiff peaks.

19. Add a dollop of blueberry curd into the divet. Decorate with fresh blueberries. Serve.
