### Ingredients:
- 24 oz mascarpone cream, cold
- 6 egg yolks
- 5 egg whites
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla bean paste
- 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- pinch of salt
Caramelized Bananas: 
- 1/2 tsp miso
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1/2 tsp vanilla bean paste
- 1/3 cup heavy cream
- 2 bananas, yellow and fully ripe but with no brown spots
For Assembly: 
- 40 lady fingers
- 2 cups fresh espresso or very strong coffee
- 2 tbsp dark rum or baileys
- 1 ripe banana, fully ripe but with minimal brown spots
- cocoa powder

### Recipe:
1. For the cream: In the bowl of a stand mixer, on med high, whip the eg whites and sugar until stiff peaks form. In a separate large bowl, mix the mascarpone cream with the egg yolks until fully incorporated. Mix in the spices, vanilla, and salt. In increments, fold the whipped egg whites into the egg yolk mixture until combined. 
2. For the bananas: In a med saucepan add the butter, vanilla, and sugar over med heat until everything is just melted. Add the banana slices to the pan with the miso, on med heat, occasionally swirling the pan and tossing the slices to prevent burning until the bananas are lightly caramelized. 
3. Remove the bananas from the pan and carefully pour the heavy cream into the remaining caramel mixture. Whisk to mix everything together, then let cool before assembly. 
4. To assemble: In a shallow bowl, mix rum and espresso for dipping. Dunk the ladyfingers into the mixture on each side for 1-2 secs and add to a 9x13 pan, side by side. Continue until the bottom is covered in ladyfingers. 
5. OPTION 1 (Whole Banana Slices): Add about 1/2 of the cream mixture on top of the soaked ladyfingers and spread out evenly. Scatter the caramelized bananas on top along with the raw banana slices, followed with about 1/2 of the caramel. Layer again with the coffee-dipped lady fingers, lightly pressing them into the cream and another drizzle of caramel. Top with the other half of the cream, piping designs if desired. 
6. OPTION 2 (Banana Pudding): Mash up the caramelized bananas with the back of a fork and fold directly into the cream mixture. This will give a more uniform banana flavor. Add half of this cream to the bottom layer of ladyfingers, followed with the raw banana slices and miso caramel drizzle. Repeat with the second layer of dipped ladyfingers, another drizzle of miso caramel, and the last layer of cream. 
7. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate tiramisu overnight, then powder the top with cocoa powder. Serve.
