### Ingredients:
- 3 shots espresso plus enough water to make 2 cups liquid, or 2 cups strongly brewed coffee
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 tsp agar agar powder, or enough gelatin to set 2 cups liquid
- 3/4 cup condensed milk
- 3/4 cup oat milk

### Recipe:
1. Into a 2 cup measuring cup, add espresso, sugar, agar agar, and enough water to bring it up to the 2 cup level. Transfer into a small pot and bring mixture to a simmer, whisking constantly until fully dissolved. 
2. Simmer gently for 1 min to activate agar agar. Check on the back of a metal spoon that no granules remain. (If using gelatin, skip this step).
3. Pour into a mold - I used a 7 1/2 x 5" rectangular dish. Let cool at room temp for 30 mins, then in the fridge for 3 hrs, until fully set. 
4. Meanwhile, mix condensed milk and milk. Chill in fridge.
5. Once coffee jelly is set, use a small knife to run around the edge and cut jelly into 1/2" cubes. 
6. Serve in glassware and pour chilled sweet milk on top to serve.
