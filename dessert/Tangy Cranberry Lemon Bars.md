### Ingredients:
For the Crust: 
- 1 stick unsalted butter, softened
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 cup + 2 tbsp AP flour
- 1 tbsp lemon zest
For the Cranberry Jam: 
- 8 oz cranberries
- 1/2 cup water
- 6 tbsp sugar
For the Lemon Curd:
- 3 large eggs, room temp
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 tbsp AP flour
- 1/2 cup lemon juice
- 1 tbsp lemon zest

### Recipe:
1. In a med sized pot, add cranberries, sugar, and water. Bring to a simmer and cook until cranberries break down. Use the back of a spatula to crush the cranberries. Once thickened and mostly smooth, remove from heat and allow to cool.
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
3. In a med sized mixing bowl, add butter, sugar, flour, lemon zest, and vanilla extract. Using hands, combine until crumbly but able to clump.
4. Line a 8x8 baking pan with parchment paper and a bit of baking spray. Add shortbread mixture to the pan and press down until roughly even. With a fork, lightly prick dough.
5. Bake for 30 mins. Remove and allow to cool slightly, ~5 mins. Lower heat to 325 degrees. 
6. In a mixing bowl, combine eggs, lemon juice, and lemon zest. 
7. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour and sugar. Pour wet into dry and whisk together. Mixture will be quite thin. 
8. When crust has cool, add the cooled cranberry sauce to the top. Use a rubber spatula to spread evenly across the crust. 
9. With a large spoon turned round side up, slowly layer the lemon mixture over the cranberry mixture. 
10. Carefully transfer to the oven and bake for 25-35 mins, or until well set. 
11. Remove and cool in fridge 2 hours to overnight. 
12. Sprinkle with powdered sugar, slice, and serve.
