### Ingredients:
- 12 oz semisweet chocolate chips
- 16 oz silken tofu
- 1/2 cup maple syrup

### Recipe:
1. Melt chocolate chips in a heat safe bowl in the microwave in 30 sec intervals, stirring well between each interval, until fully melted. 
2. Add melted chocolate, vanilla extract, tofu, and maple syrup to a blender and blend on high until smooth and creamy.
