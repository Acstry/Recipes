### Ingredients:
- [[Glaze]]
- 250g sour cherry jam
Dough:
- 350g AP flour 
- 50g sugar
- 12g instant yeast
- 150ml milk, room temp
- 80g butter, soft
- 1 egg, room temp
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 lemon, zested
Streusel: 
- 175g AP flour
- 125g sugar
- 125g butter, soft
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

### Recipe:
1. For the Dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer, add in the flour, sugar, and yeast and then whisk to combine. 
2. Add in the milk, butter, egg, lemon zest, and vanilla. 
3. Using the dough hook, knead the dough on med low speed until smooth. 
4. Shape dough into a ball and place in a lightly greased bowl, cover with a towel and place somewhere warm to rise for 45 mins, or until doubled in size. 
5. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
6. For the Streusel: In a med bowl whisk together the flour and sugar. Then add in the butter and vanilla. 
7. Rub the butter in the dry ingredients using a fork until all of the butter has been fully mixed in. 
8. To assemble: Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Lightly sprinkle proofed dough with flour and punch out air. 
9. Lightly flour a work surface and pat dough into skinny rectangle. Roll out dough to 20x45cm, rolling short end closer to you a little thinner. 
10. Spoon 200g of jam over the surface of rolled dough and spread with a spatula over whole surface, all the way to edges. 
11. Starting with the short side closer to you, roll the dough up tight, but not tight enough to squeeze out jam. 
12. Use a knife and ruler to mark the roll into 1" slices. Cut along marks to form rolls. Lay slices onto each baking sheet. 
13. Tuck about a 1/2" of the end of each swirl under each roll. Gently press down on the top of each slice to help form large swirl. 
14. Crumble streusel on top of each slice. Gently press streusel into each roll with a couple tsp dollops of remaining jam. 
15. Leave rolls to proof for ~20 mins, they should grow slightly and are a little puffy. 
16. To Bake: When proofed, bake for 10 mins in oven. Then, swap pans, rotate, and bake for another 10-15 mins until golden brown. 
17. For the Glaze: Scoop powdered sugar into a med mixing bowl and add in the lemon juice. Whisk to combine into a thin glaze. 
18. To Finish: Remove rolls from oven and place on wire cooling racks. 
19. Immediately brush/drizzle lemon glaze onto roll then leave to cool before serving.
